    with that let me turn things over to
    Pat thank you John and good afternoon
    everyone Q4 was the culmination of a
    year of tremendous progress towards our
    IDM 2.0 transformation we consistently
    executed on our plan to reest establish
    process leadership further build out our
    capacity and Foundry plans greatly
    improveed product execution and began to
    execute an our mission to bring AI
    everywhere across our product segments
    we delivered solid Q4 results exceeding
    expectations for the fourth quarter in a
    row Revenue was at the higher end of our
    guidance and we had strong EPS upside as
    a result of our ongoing Relentless focus
    on driving operating leverage and
    expense management including comfortably
    meeting our 3 billion cost savings
    commitment for fiscal year
    23 2023 was definitely a year when we
    did what we said we would do and more we
    intend to make 2024 another such year
    and when we look out over the next 12
    months we are confident that we can
    continue to drive considerable progress
    on our IDM 2.0 Journey as we look into
    q1 our Core Business including client
    server and Edge Products continues to
    perform well and is tracking to the
    lower end of C seasonal however discreet
    headwinds including mobile eye PSG and
    business exits among others are
    impacting overall Revenue leading to a
    lower q1 guide importantly we see this
    as temporary and we expect sequential
    and year on-year growth in both revenue
    and EPS for each quarter of fiscal year
    24 momentum and excitement around new
    products and businesses remain strong as
    we head into the year and will grow
    stronger as the year progresses
    we could not be prouder of the execution
    across our process technology road map
    in 2023 we became the world's first high
    volume manufacturer of logic devices
    using euv in both the US and Europe as
    we aggressively ramp core Ultra on Intel
    4 in both Oregon and Ireland Intel 3
    achieved manufacturing Readiness in Q4
    as committed with solid performance and
    yield progression our two lead vehicles
    in Intel 3 are on track and we look
    forward to lach launching Sierra Forest
    in first half 24 followed shortly
    thereafter by Granite
    Rapids Sierra Forest has final samples
    at customers and the production stepping
    of granite Rapids is running ahead of
    schedule well into Power own validation
    and very
    healthy we are even more excited about
    breaking into the angstrom ERA with
    Intel 20a and Intel
    18a we are first in Industry to have
    Incorporated both gate allaround and
    backside power delivery in a single
    process node the latter and expected two
    years ahead of our competition aerol
    Lake our lead Intel 208 vehicle will
    launch this year Intel e is expected to
    achieve manufacturing Readiness in
    second half 24 completing our five nodes
    in four-year journey and bringing us
    back to process leadership I am pleased
    to say that clearw Forest our first
    Intel 18a part for servers has already
    gone into Fab and Panther Lake for
    clients will be heading into Fab shortly
    as we complete our goal of five nodes in
    four years we are not satisfied nor are
    we finished we have begun installation
    of the industry's first H euv tool in
    our most advanced technology development
    site in Oregon aimed at addressing
    challenges Beyond
    at&a we remain focused on being good
    stewards of Moors law and ensuring a
    continuous node migration path over the
    next decade and Beyond thirdparty
    engagements with ifs continue validate
    our progress on processed technology we
    launched ifs with a long-term view of
    delivering the world's first system
    Foundry that brings together a secure
    and sustainable supply chain with the
    best of Intel and our ecosystem while
    our Ambitions will not materialize
    overnight we made tremendous progress in
    both Q4 and fiscal year 23 towards our
    goal of becoming the second largest
    external Foundry by
    2030 the rapid adoption of AI by all
    Industries is proving to be a sign
    significant Tailwind for ifs as high
    performance compute an area where we
    have considerable wafer and packaging
    knowhow and IP is now one of the largest
    and fastest growing segments of the
    semiconductor
    Market we made major strides in building
    our Foundry ecosystem in 2023 with now
    over 40 strategic agreements across Eda
    Design Services IP cloud and US military
    Aerospace and government critical
    agreements with r synopsis continue to
    gain momentum we delivered the Intel 18a
    0.9 pdk and broaden its availability in
    Q4 we expanded the ramp C program
    significantly and just this quarter
    signed a major Foundry contract with the
    United States government and Department
    of Defense we are also very pleased to
    have completed a major agreement with
    United micro Electronics or UMC to
    develop a 12 nanometer process platform
    targeting high growth markets in
    including mobile communication
    infrastructure and networking this
    expands both Intel and umc's Foundry
    process portfolios and customer access
    to a broader and more resilient Supply
    leveraging our Arizona site this
    agreement builds upon and further our
    long and deep relationships with the
    vibrant Taiwan ecosystem this also
    meaningfully extends the production life
    of our installed capacity and improves
    our Returns on investments similar to
    the oun M last quarter of our Tower
    semiconductor partnership at the 65 n
    meter node with our New Mexico site our
    success with ifs will be measured by
    customer commitments and revenue we have
    taped out more than 75 ecosystem and
    customer test chips ifs already has more
    than 50 test chips in the pipeline
    across 2024 and 2025 75% of which are on
    Intel 18a during CES we welcomed Valen
    semiconductor to the growing list The
    Foundry customers as they announced they
    would use ifs to fabricate their mippy a
    chipsets using our advanced technology
    in addition to the three Intel at&
    customers we disclosed in Q3 we want a
    key design win with a significant high
    performance Computing customer this
    customer was particularly motivated by
    our unique Leading Edge manufacturing
    capabilities and US capacity we came
    into 2023 committing to one ATA Foundry
    customer we executed on four inclusive
    of a meaningful prepay and our momentum
    continues to grow our Advanced packaging
    business is proving to be yet another
    important Advantage for ifs a faster
    on-ramp to broader Foundry relationships
    during the quarter we captured three
    additional Advanced packaging design WIS
    bringing the total to five in 2023 with
    the majority of revenu starting in
    2025 to support our growing demand just
    yesterday we open open Fab 9 in New
    Mexico marking a milestone for high
    volume 3D Advanced packaging
    manufacturing the momentum Advanced
    packaging is very strong and is another
    facet of our Foundry strategy which is
    clearly benefiting from The Surge of
    interest in
    AI with leadership technology and
    available capacity our opportunity set
    continues to grow in total across wafer
    and advanced packaging our lifetime deal
    value for ifs is now over 10 billion
    more than doubling from the 4 billion we
    provided in our last
    update supporting our growing momentum
    and ifs is our Global manufacturing
    footprint we're the only Semiconductor
    Company with that scale and sustainable
    Manufacturing in every major region of
    the world providing ourselves and our
    Foundry customers resilient access to
    the right capacity in the right regions
    at the right time all of our expansion
    projects in the US EU and Asia are
    progressing on schedule and our chips
    applications in the US and EU are
    progressing well finally we are thrilled
    to be hosting our first Foundry Day ifs
    direct connect on February 21st in San
    Jose where we will have the opportunity
    to showcase the breadth of our ecosystem
    as well as begin to talk about our
    process road map Beyond Intel at& Next
    Generation packaging and our full
    Foundry Vision we hope to see many of
    you
    there Intel continues its mission to
    bring AI everywhere we see the AI
    workload as a key driver of the1
    trillion semiconductor Tam by 2030 and
    given our Foundry and product offerings
    we're the only company able to
    participate in 100% of the Tam for AI
    silicon
    logic we have already discussed how our
    50-year heritage in high- performance
    Computing transistors and our Advanced
    packaging positions ifs to benefit from
    the accelerating move to AI within our
    product portfolio we are the only
    company with the products IP and
    ecosystem reach to empower customers to
    seamlessly integrate and effectively run
    AI in all their applications from the
    cloud through the network into the
    Enterprise client and Edge for the
    developer working with multi-trillion
    parameter Frontier models in the cloud
    gouty and our suite of AI accelerators
    provides a powerful combination of
    performance competitive ml perf
    benchmarks and Leadership
    TCO as Ai proliferates and the world
    moves towards more AI integrated
    application there's a market shift
    toward local inferencing and smaller
    more Nimble models it's a nod to both
    the necessity of data privacy and an
    answer to its cloud-based impressing
    cost and roundtrip
    latency with AI accelerated Zeon for
    Enterprise core Ultra ushering in the
    aipc era and open Veno enabling
    developers seamless and versatile
    support for a range of client and Edge
    silicon we are bringing AI to where the
    data is being generated and used rather
    than requiring it in the cloud our
    expansive footprint spanning cloud and
    Enterprise servers to volume clients and
    ubiquitous EDG devices positions us well
    to enable the AI Continuum across all
    our market segments and Q4 our server
    business experienced solid sequential
    growth consistent with market share
    which we believe was flat with Q3 levels
    since launching fourth gen Zeon in early
    2023 we have shipped more than 2.5
    million units with approximately
    onethird of all fourth gen demand driven
    by AI with our fifth gen Zeon launch we
    enable up to 42% higher AI inference
    performance compared to the
    industry-leading fourth gen xon fifth
    gen xon has reached General availability
    at Alibaba is entering public and
    private previews with several CSP Fe and
    is on track to ship with oems next month
    more importantly our improved execution
    is strengthening our product portfolio
    with Gen 4 and Gen 5 zon ramping well
    Sierra Forest and granite Rapids coming
    soon and Clearwater Forest already going
    into the Fab momentum is building and
    positioning us well to win back share in
    the data
    center our gy 2 AI accelerators continue
    to demonstrate price performance
    leadership compared to the most Prof
    gpus in a recent blog published by data
    bricks gouty 2 was shown to clearly
    deliver the best training and inference
    performance per dollar based on public
    Cloud pricing we're building on this
    momentum with gudy 3 which is on track
    to launch this year and is expected to
    deliver performance leadership with 4X
    the processing power and double the
    networking bandwidth for greater
    scaleout performance gudy 3 is now in
    the lab powered on and showing great
    health and performance and Falcon Shores
    is also well
    underway our accelerator pipeline for
    2024 grew double digits sequentially in
    Q4 and is now well above two billion and
    growing we recently increased our supply
    for both g 2 and gouty 3 to support the
    growing customer demand and we expect
    meaningful Revenue acceleration
    throughout the year as we announced last
    quarter we are now operating PSG as a
    standalone business beginning on January
    1st our intent is to bring in private
    Capital this year to create an eventual
    path to an IPO over the coming years as
    we outlined on our Q3 call PSG is in the
    midst of an industrywide cyclical
    correction for fpgas which we expect to
    last through the first half of 24
    despite the financial correction
    operational momentum is strong and PSG
    executed its most ambitious fpga road
    map delivering 21 new product releases
    in 2023 and executing Supply Assurance
    agreements valued by our
    customers finally even as we
    congratulate Sandra Rivera the new CEO
    of PSG I'm am extremely pleased to
    welcome Justin hotard as Executive Vice
    President and general manager of
    DCI Justin joined us from hulet Packard
    Enterprise where he was Executive Vice
    President and general manager of high
    performance Computing Ai and Labs he
    will play a key role in helping
    customers accelerate their businesses
    with our Zeon processor family
    delivering on our commitments to
    customers and partners by increasing our
    GPU and accelerator footprint and
    supporting our mission to bring AI
    everywhere moving to client ccg
    performed very well in Q4 posting the
    third consecutive quarter of double
    digit sequential growth demand reflected
    a normalized inventory environment with
    sustained strength in gaming and
    commercial with our highest end skes
    exceeding Q3 records by 20% the 2023
    consumption Tam was roughly 270 million
    units consistent with our views entering
    the year and we expect the PC Tam up low
    single digits year on year in 2024 in
    line with thirdparty estimates our share
    position is strong and our product
    portfolio for 2024 and Beyond an
    ecosystem work will continue to drive
    industry-leading performance and
    experiences in Q4 we ushered in the age
    of the
    aipc with the launch of Intel Core Ultra
    representing our largest architectural
    shift in decades the core Ultra is the
    most AI capable and power efficient
    client processor with dedicated
    acceleration capabilities across the CPU
    GPU and neural Processing Unit or
    npu Ultra is the centerpiece of the
    aipc systems that are capable of
    natively running popular 10 billion
    parameter models and Drive Superior
    performance on key AI enhanced
    applications like Zoom Adobe and
    Microsoft we expect to ship
    approximately 40 million AIP PCS in 2024
    alone with more than 230 designs from
    ultra thin PCS to handheld gaming
    devices to be delivered this year from
    OEM Partners Acer Asus Dell HP Lenovo LG
    MSI Samsung electronics and others the
    core Ultra platform delivers leadership
    AI performance today with our next
    Generation platforms launching later
    this year lunar Lake and aerrow Lake
    tripling our AI performance in 2025 with
    Panther Lake we will grow AI performance
    up to an additional
    2x NX is well positioned to benefit from
    the proliferation of AI workloads on the
    edge where our Market leading hardware
    and software assets provides improved
    latency reliability and cost open Veno
    adoption grew by 60% sequentially in Q4
    and today is a core software layer for
    AI inferencing on the edge on the PC and
    in the data center neex is also driving
    the shift of AI networking in the cloud
    from proprietary Technologies to open
    ethernet-based approaches in partnership
    with the broader industry ecosystem nexx
    Q4 results be t internal forecast and
    the division is poised for solid growth
    in 2024 across Edge Network and fnck
    products more skewed to the second
    half yet another growing Market
    opportunity for us is Automotive while
    Mobil is experiencing a sharp inventory
    correction in q1 we are encouraged by
    their improving forecast throughout 2024
    and more importantly their recent
    announcement at CES that they were
    awarded a series of production design
    wins by a major Western automaker across
    the company's three key platforms
    supervision chauffeur and drive in
    addition to mobilized strengths and AV
    at CES we announced the launch of AI
    enhanced software defined vehicle s so's
    with G zika brand as our first omm
    partner and our agreement to acquire
    silicon Mobility a fabulous silicon and
    software company specializing in power
    management s so's focused on EVS these
    announcements build on shared IP across
    client and data center and our existing
    Intel s so footprint of more than 50
    million Vehicles worldwide our strategy
    will continue to broaden our exposure to
    the growing auto market on both the
    product and The Foundry sides of our
    business finally underpinning our cross
    theboard progress in 2023 is our
    operational and financial discipline as
    our new internal Foundry model which is
    is designed to drive greater
    transparency accountability and focus on
    cost begins to take root we expect to
    unlock further cost savings and
    efficiencies in 2024 and Beyond we have
    officially transitioned to this new
    operating model in January 1 and will'll
    Report the new segmentation format as
    part of our q1 earnings we see
    incremental efficiencies as we drive to
    our long-term model of 60% gross and 40%
    operating margin
    as I reflect on our progress in 2023 I
    am incredibly proud of our employees
    whose commitment and perseverance were
    instrumental to the execution of our
    ambitious strategy together we exited
    the year accomplishing exactly what we
    set out to do we improved our execution
    engine consistently being on track or
    ahead on our process and product road
    map and as I said at the beginning of my
    remarks we are confident in our
    performance and financial trajectory for
    the year ahead we know we have much work
    in front of us as we work to regain and
    build on our leadership position in
    every category in which we participate
    we will maintain our Relentless focus on
    our mission and commitment to driving
    long-term value for our shareholders
    with that let me turn things over to
    Dave thank you Pat and good afternoon
    everyone we delivered strong financial
    results in the quarter on top of
    continued execution of our products and
    process roadmap commitments we again
    beat our guidance across Revenue gross
    margin and
    EPS we've taken proactive steps to
    prioritize our investments aggressively
    managed near-term expenses and made
    meaningful progress on reducing our
    structural cost gaps we exit 2023 a
    healthier and leaner company but there
    is much more work to do in 2024 and
    Beyond to deliver on our long-term
    Financial objectives and the potential
    of IDM 2.0
    fourth quarter Revenue was $15.4 billion
    up 9% sequentially 10% year-over year
    and $300 million above the midpoint of
    our Guidance with solid execution across
    reported
    segments gross margin was
    48.8% 230 basis points better than our
    guidance driven by favorable product mix
    and asps improved unit costs and higher

    results ccg delivered revenue of $8.8
    billion up 12% sequentially 33%
    year-over-year and ahead of internal
    expectations for the fourth consecutive
    quarter we saw sustained strength in
    gaming and Commercial segments along
    with record performance notebooks
    shipments and the
    quarter customer inventory levels have
    no normalized and 2023 PC consumption
    was in line with our 270 million unit

    Revenue as Pat summarized the company
    made significant progress towards our
    IDM 2.0 strategy including strong
    execution against our 2023 Financial
    commitments despite macro headwinds
    throughout the year as committed at our
    q123 earnings call we delivered Revenue
    gross margin operating margin and EPS
    growth each
    quarter despite significant investments
    in future growth and continued
    progression through five nodes in four
    years we achieved our 2020 three
    commitment of $3 billion of spending
    reductions through a strong focus on
    cash and cost controls we achieved
    excellent DSO and DPO in the second half
    of 2023 and delivered net inventory
    reductions of nearly $2 billion in 35
    days from our peak in
    q123 working capital initiatives yielded
    roughly $2 billion of cash in 2023
    helping us to meet our commitment for
    roughly Break Even adjusted free cash
    flow in the second half of the year we
    remain committed to our smart Capital
    framework with growing contributions
    from our skip agreement with Brookfield
    and progress toward government
    incentives in the US Europe and
    Israel in Q4 we also recognized $845
    million of advanced manufacturing
    investment credits or Amic as defined in
    the chips act while our continued IDM
    2.0 Capital investments will result in
    increased gross cap backs in 24 as
    compared to 23 we're on track to our
    aggregate 2023 through 2024 guidance of
    net capex spending in the mid-30s as a
    percent of Revenue with offsets towards
    the high end of the 20 to 30%
    range now turning to q1 guidance we
    expect q1 revenue of 12.2 to 13.2
    billion at the q1 revenue midpoint of
    12.7 billion we expect gross margin of
    approximately 44.5% % with a tax rate of
    133% and EPS of 13 C while we expect a
    slightly subseasonal first quarter from
    our core product businesses we see
    material inventory Corrections in Mobile
    ey and PSG additionally we expect a
    significant drop in ifs Revenue after
    seeing accelerated purchasing in our
    traditional packaging business and
    cyclical weakness in wafer equipment
    buying in the first half of the Year
    impacting the IMs business
    when combined with businesses we exited
    in 2023 we expect a roughly $1 billion
    sequential Revenue impact from
    businesses outside of our core
    products with Market signals remaining
    positive for PC demand and usage rates
    we expect Tam to grow in the low single
    digits in 2024 consistent with
    thirdparty views our recent results show
    the PC remains essential and we remain
    confident in our longer term Tam
    forecast as the age of the aipc further
    enhances the value of device refresh we
    expect q1 data center Revenue to decline
    double digigit percent sequentially
    before improving through the year while
    the data center has seen some wallet
    share shift between CPU and accelerators
    over the last several quarters we expect
    growth in CPU compute cores to return to
    more normal historical rates and our
    discret accelerator portfolio with well
    over $2 billion in pipeline to gain
    traction as we move through
    2024 within next Telco markets are
    likely to remain weak through the year
    though we expect solid growth from our
    Network ethnic and Edge Products these
    signals give us confidence that
    Consolidated Revenue will grow Beyond
    typical seasonality after a soft q1 and
    that we can deliver sequential and
    year-over-year growth in both revenue
    and eps each quarter of
    2024 we're confident we can grow
    earnings faster than Revenue this year
    and maintain roughly Break Even adjusted
    free cash flow though I'll remind you
    that the rapid pace of delivering five
    nodes in four years and capacity
    expansion in support of external Foundry
    commitments remain headwinds on the pace
    of our margin expansion we expect
    appreciation to grow by approximately $2
    billion in 2024 in addition to a
    significant increase in variable Factory
    startup
    costs 60% gross margin flow through as a
    percent of Revenue growth remains a rule
    of thumb in aggregate in the
    intermediate term though we may see
    volatility in our quarterly gross margin
    results we're excited to Mark the first
    month fully operating under our new
    internal Foundry reporting structure
    with improved accountability
    transparency around cost and value
    drivers and increased focus on driving
    higher rates of return for our owners
    Capital we intend to provide you with a
    recast historical financials this
    quarter in the form of an 8K we will
    unpack the details at that time but you
    will see not only the first view of our
    manufacturing p&l but a view of our
    products group more in line with
    external peers what will come as no
    surprise our manufacturing p&l is under
    significant pressure as we get back to
    process leadership and build the
    infrastructure to meet both internal and
    external demand we see abund an
    opportunity to drive
    Improvement finally standing up a
    separate legal entity for manufacturing
    technology development and ifs is
    important to our Foundry customers we
    expect to have that structure in place
    in the second half of
    2024 as we look back at 2023 we' have a
    lot to be proud of we entered the year
    with a challenging macro backdrop I'm
    pleased with our team's efforts
    controlling spending ramping new
    products managing share executing
    product and process road maps and
    delivering for our customers we continue
    to focus our portfolio by exiting five
    businesses in 2023 for a total of 10
    since P's return while also identifying
    profitable adjacent markets we can serve
    with our existing IP as we have done
    with Intel Auto we executed within our
    smart Capital framework and are
    beginning to see meaningful Capital
    offsets we unlock value for our
    shareholders ERS through mobile ey and
    IMS and announced Our intention to
    pursue external investments in
    PSG I'd like to thank the entire Intel
    team for the hard work and execution
    which drove our improved 2023 results
    while we aren't yet where we want to be
    from a financial perspective we're
    participating in a large and growing
    semiconductor T our Foundry and AI
    assets are showing great momentum in the
    market and with the strong Foundation of
    financial discipline we set in 2023
    we're confident and committed to our
    long-term Financial objectives with that
    let me turn the call back over to
    John we will now transition to the Q&A
    portion of our call as a reminder we ask
    each of you to ask one question and a
    brief followup where applicable with
    that Jonathan can we please take the
    first question certainly one moment for
    our first question and our first
    question comes from the line of Ross
    Seymour from DOA Bank your question
    please hi guys thanks for let me ask a
    question uh have a near-term one and
    then for my followup it'll be a longer
    term one uh so the near-term one is on
    the demand picture uh Dave you were
    helpful in breaking up the kind of the
    non-core impacts in the first quarter
    versus the core but the low end of
    seasonality is is a little bit of
    surprise given that cyclical pressure
    seem to have been abating and and some
    of the market share Trends should have
    been going in your favor at least also
    not worsening so can you just talk a
    little bit about why you're at the low
    end of seasonality in the first quarter
    for your core businesses and what gives
    you confidence in super seasonality
    thereafter yeah hey thanks Ross I'll
    start and ask Dave to follow up and you
    know you know first what seasonality Q4
    to q1 there's a wide range of
    perspectives anywhere from 3% to 20%
    historically so I'll just say it's a
    wide statement of what that looks like
    obviously as we come into the year it's
    coming off a very strong Q4 you know our
    product lines are strong we feel our
    inventory positions are healthy you know
    we're gaining momentum across it and
    obviously we've built the for consistent
    with our customers and channel Partners
    you know that we believe is merited
    obviously Dave talked about some of the
    discreet events which you know as we
    added them up were a little bit larger
    than we forecast but you know the core
    business we see is healthy uh for it we
    see no areas for market share loss and
    the products are getting stronger so
    we'll say it really reflects as we view
    the market but we've also said hey we're
    improving every quarter as we go through
    the year right improving on Revenue uh
    Topline improving on uh uh profitability
    as we go through the year and we've
    quite scrutinized that outlook for the
    year and obviously as the year improves
    you know new product lines emerging ta
    winds in areas like aipc you know gouty
    ramping for accelerators overall a lot
    of things that just keep improving as we
    go through the year combined with good
    cost discipline we feel quite
    comfortable that we're starting strong
    and we're going to have a improving year
    as the year progresses and what's the
    long-term question
    BR you just the confidence in oh oh just
    second ask the longterm question is one
    yeah sorry the longterm question is one
    on the manufacturing nodes uh the five
    nodes in four years is going well but
    you know one of your biggest Foundry
    well customers and competitors is
    doubling down on on their ability to
    keep the leadership positioning uh so
    what gives you confidence that ATA will
    in fact have the leadership node and how
    do we reconcile the fact that you seem
    to be using that customer as a Foundry
    partner for some of your heterogeneous
    products whether it be AOL lake or L
    Lake going forward if you have the
    leadership why wouldn't you be doing
    that
    internally yeah thank you I'll I'll do
    that and ask Dave to pile on both of
    those a little bit uh but uh you know
    with respect to the manufacturing I'll
    just say hey we we look at this every
    single day and we're scrutinizing
    carefully our progress on 18a and
    obviously the great news that we uh just
    described those clear water Forest
    taping out you know that gives us a lot
    of confidence that atna is healthy
    that's a major product for us Panther
    Lake following that shortly you know
    we've also had our fourth customer uh
    this quarter some of the IP providers
    are giving us very strong uh
    affirmations on the competitiveness of
    the process technology and particularly
    we is way ahead on backside power you
    know and that's not even you know
    everybody in the industry is recognizing
    that and many of the uh customers who
    are looking at it are seeing substantial
    gains not just in power performance but
    in area savings as well so overall we
    feel very confident that uh our road map
    is strong on the process uh technology
    side you we do uh use external
    foundaries and obviously that grew as we
    were dealing with some of our own
    challenges for process competitiveness
    and uh as we uh create more and more
    focus in the business more Wafers will
    come internal uh to the Intel Factory
    network but long term we're going to
    continue to use external foundaries to
    complement manage our capital
    requirements and to uh make sure that
    our teams always are building the best
    uh products uh in the uh industry and
    using the best Technologies to
    accomplish that so overall we feel super
    good with our strategy you'll see more
    use of our own Factory Network even as
    we leverage external foundaries where
    appropriate I the only other thing I'd
    add is just you know the use of external
    foundaries as part of our smart Capital
    strategy it's one of the Five Pillars so
    as Pat said you know that will continue
    to be part of our strategy obviously you
    know we're going to maximize how much we
    can do internally but we're always going
    to be using external foundaries um based
    on Smart Capital thanks Ross Jonathan
    the next question please certainly one
    moment for our next
    question and our next question comes
    from the line of timotha Curry from UBS
    your question
    please thanks a lot Dave um I had a
    question about gross margin uh it was
    you know obviously much much better in
    December and the you know March guidance
    is actually pretty good so does this
    include the sale of any previously
    written down inventory and you know
    maybe help us get a clean margin number
    is this is this March number pretty
    clean that we can carry that uh
    incremental forward through the year
    yeah I mean what what I said in the
    prepared remarks I think is that you
    know we think that a 60% fall through is
    probably the best rule of thumb um that
    said as you know quarter to quarter
    things you know can move that number up
    and down uh in Q4 we saw better fall
    through uh you know largely it was
    related to better sell through of
    previously reserved um uh product we
    also actually did better on the factory
    side in terms of spending and yield and
    so that that also benefited us um to
    some extent and then in q1 you know I
    think we're going to do a little worse
    we're going to see the fall through be a
    little harder on us um and uh you know
    largely that's some of that stuff going
    away a little bit but I think if you
    look at it on a year-over-year basis you
    know kind of a 23 to 24 24 to 25 we'd
    largely expect it to be this 60%
    uh fall through we're going to have
    these you know quarter to quarter um
    movements that that kind of violate that
    uh you know because of just you know
    oneof things but I think in general
    you'll see you'll see 60% fall through
    be the right the right measure um you
    know longer term we're obviously going
    to want to see that number go up uh
    because it's going to drive you know us
    to the 60% gross margins we ultimately
    want to attain but in the near term
    we're kind of dealing with a lot of the
    costs associated with five nodes in four
    years there just a lot of startup cost
    fact we'll probably hit our Peak startup
    cost in 2024 so that's a huge headwind
    we'll have to deal with so that's going
    to I think kind of keep us in this 60%
    fall through range uh for the next
    couple years Tim do you have a follow-up
    question I do I do Dave um yeah just on
    the how you get to that 60% so um it
    seems like you know there could be
    persistent headwinds in terms of you
    know capacity utilization um I mean I
    think a lot of us see that there's this
    plan to cut over to internal you know
    starting with Panther Lake but that
    doesn't really ramp into high volume
    until probably 2026 so are you managing
    to some sort of like utilization rate
    for your internal uh capacity to sort of
    get to that 60% thanks yeah well maybe
    maybe step back a little bit on the 60%
    I mean I it will be driven by a number
    of factors one of which is just Revenue
    you know Revenue growing on a largely
    fixed cost business is going to help uh
    gross margins obviously we we have um
    you know optimism around how we can
    drive the growth of the business um the
    second as you point out is loadings and
    we are managing um our Capital spend and
    our investment um you know with the with
    an ey on loadings to make sure that we
    keep those um in a good place obviously
    last year we were you know we had some
    under loadings to deal with uh but as we
    kind of break out of that and start to
    move into the next year I think we'll
    start to see uh some improvements uh
    there uh third you know as we get uh as
    Pat was talking about you know to
    leadership in terms of nodes and
    products um ultimately across the entire
    higher product portfolio that's going to
    help out on margins it's going to help
    out from a cost structure perspective
    but also better performing products are
    just going to yield uh you know better
    pricing and so forth better better
    profitability and then lastly you know
    we've got um you know this internal
    Foundry model that um that Pat mentioned
    uh and I mentioned in the prepared
    remarks that we think is going to
    deliver just tons of savings uh for the
    company um you know I think every week
    that Pat and I spend on this somebody
    brings up another big rock that they
    found of of of savings they can identify
    um as because they were looking at the
    business in an entirely different way
    than they're used to looking at it um
    you know the product groups are now
    hyper focused on test times and you know
    how many what sort of like hot Lots they
    do and how much sample activity they use
    um you know the factor is now very as
    you point out very very hyperfocused on
    loadings and making sure they're
    properly thinking about their Capital
    Investments Associated uh with the the
    loadings we're we're way more focused in
    terms of steppings and and so forth so I
    think we'll get like I said um in a call
    a couple of quarters ago four to five
    billion dollars of savings uh from this
    internal Foundry model uh ultimately and
    so you know that's another big step
    function that I think gets us to the 60%
    gross margins I I'd also add you know
    things like we just announced with UMC
    right uh we're taking older factories
    and as uh Tim as you might have heard me
    say in the past right a bug in the Intel
    business model right just when a factory
    got very good and depreciated right we
    moved to the next node well now we're
    starting to fill that with long-term
    Foundry business as well so all of these
    are improving the discipline of running
    the business as well as how we utilize
    our Factory networks uh long term and we
    really do think that the 6040 is what
    Dave and I are driving the business to
    and we're going to get there thanks Tim
    Jonathan can we have the next question
    please certainly one moment for our next
    question and our next question comes
    from the line of Joseph Moore from
    Morgan Stanley your question
    please great thank you um I wonder if
    you could talk about the the data center
    decline in q1 um how much of that as a
    function of the weakness in fpj that
    you've talked to already and then just
    you know any sense of what the the cloud
    and server environment is like in the in
    the first
    quarter yeah so overall when you fact
    obviously we've spoken separately about
    the fpga business so let's just move
    that to the side of overall you know
    I'll say it's fairly seasonal uh quarter
    to quarter and what we expect you know
    that said we're seeing strength uh from
    our server customers uh for instance uh
    more of the OEM uh response is strong uh
    with regard to the momentum they're
    seeing in the Enterprise server uh
    business and obviously our product line
    uh is improving there we do expect year
    ande growth here we see our market share
    stabilizing and obviously as we're
    ramping set you know Gen 4 Gen 5 Granite
    rapid crr the momentum is building you
    know for us overall and as we indicated
    hey we think more of the AI surge is
    going to result in AI inferencing on
    Prem you know which were well positioned
    uh to be a beneficiary up I would just
    cite uh that here we are in year 20 of
    the public cloud and you have 60% plus
    of compute in the cloud but 80 plus% of
    data remains on Prem right customers
    want to realize the value of that on
    Prem data with AI and that's an
    Enterprise strength for Intel so we do
    see all of these Trends giving us a very
    favorable Outlook uh for the year and
    there's nothing surprising about the q1
    uh guide here and uh we're going to be
    very focused on beating those numbers
    and building on the momentum of a
    improving product line Joe do have a
    follow-up question yeah along the same
    lines can you talk about um Sierra
    Forest and GR Rapids and I guess you
    know how do you see the long-term mix
    between those how what kind of appetite
    do you see for the the C Sierra for is
    kind of higher core count designs yeah
    thank you and I would love to talk for
    hours about Sierra Forest and granite
    Rapids I am super excited about those
    products you know both of them on Intel
    3 and uh you know if I build on the last
    question from Tim about Factory loadings
    hey we are driving hard to accelerate
    those uh products into the marketplace
    and they're really the drivers of Intel
    3 uh capacity you know the mix between
    them obviously this is our first I'll
    say volume you know mainstream offering
    for a high core count I sort of view
    this as the cloud guys just run VMS at
    scale or just run containers at scale
    that's what crer Forest is about is sort
    of that bulk workload and it doesn't
    have some of the performance
    capabilities Peak capabilities feature
    capabilities that Granite Rapids has I
    expect the bulk of the market to stay on
    grain up rapids uh type products the PE
    core uh products certainly in 24 and 25
    but we do see a pretty steady rise in
    the use of Sierra Forest and then as we
    move to Clearwater forest and 25 a very
    compelling uh product you know that we
    do see a pretty healthy split between
    those for the cloud and data center uh
    customers I think most of the Enterprise
    customers will stay with the PE core
    products uh that they will have and it
    really is air Forest Clear Water forest
    and successors being sort of that bulk
    mainstream uh Cloud uh offering that's
    very focused on TCO so with that we feel
    super good about our product portfolio
    peor ecores really allowing us to
    stretch the offerings to the highest
    performance with High Core count and to
    the best TCO and with that this is a a
    portfolio that will allow us to regain
    share in the core data center Market
    thanks Joe Jonathan can we have the next
    question please certainly one moment for
    our next
    question and our next question comes
    from the line of Ben rites from MOS
    research your question
    please yeah hi thanks uh appreciate it I
    wanted to revisit the gross margins and
    I appreciate the 60% flow through
    comment um you know that we should use
    as a rule on but you know Dave starting
    at
    44.5 in the first quarter how do you it
    are you still looking for the overall
    reported non-gaap number you know to be
    up um year over year from the 436 and
    you mentioned some volatility there I
    just want to clarify on the call you
    know how the gross margin trajectory is
    going to look um year-over-year
    and understanding there's that
    volatility there thanks yeah yeah to be
    clear the you know the way I was looking
    at gross margins is on a year-over year
    basis on this 60% fall through so you
    should take the full year gross margins
    uh that we had in 23 which were roughly
    43 and a half% and think about this 60%
    fall through based on the you 43.6%
    gross margins um I think when you do
    that um you we obviously um you know
    start off at a at a at a level that's
    better on a year-over-year basis but
    obviously down on a quarterly B quarter
    to quarter basis and so you should
    expect generally improving Dynamics
    through the year um the only the only
    challenge will be you know this quarter
    to quarter always has volatility to it
    so you know there could be quarters in
    which you know we get less Shi through
    of previously reserved products
    sometimes it's more and so I'm you know
    kind of avoiding trying to pinpoint
    every quarter because of the difficulty
    around pinpointing that but um but we
    feel very confident around the 60% fall
    through Ben do you have a
    followup yeah thanks John um could you
    talk about uh a little bit more about
    the client Market there was you know you
    you mentioned that uh corporate you said
    some strength and Dell had said there
    was some weakness and heading into the
    first quarter um I was can you talk
    about the revenues uh on client and uh
    what makes you so confident that it's
    that it's really going to pick up thanks
    yeah so you know as we look at the
    market year on year we expect it to be a
    few points bigger than it was last year
    so last year was 270 this year a couple
    of points higher than that I think
    that's consistent with uh the various
    Market forecasters uh that we have our
    market share position is very stable we
    had good execution on market share
    through last year and the product line
    is better this year with a number of
    Tailwinds like we said so overall we
    think it's going to be a very solid uh
    year for us in our client business
    obviously as we start the year everybody
    is uh you I'll say managing true what
    their 21 Outlook looks like even as they
    expect to see strong you know business
    as we go through the year I'd also
    comment Ben that some of these Tailwinds
    really only start to materialize as you
    go into second uh second quarter and
    second half you know aipc is just
    ramping right now the you know Windows
    10 EOS goes into effect uh and customers
    are starting to look at their postco
    refreshes so a lot of those benefits
    materialized as you go through the year
    but are position in gaming commercial
    very strong uh for us uh overall and
    I'll tell you you know just seeing a lot
    of excitement for the aipc I describ
    this the centrino moment you know the
    most exciting category defining uh
    moment uh since uh you know Wi-Fi was
    introduced two plus decades ago so we do
    think that it's going to bring a
    multi-year cycle of growth great isvs
    great new use cases and uh a product
    line that is clearly leading the
    industry establish in this category
    thanks Ben Jonathan can we have the next
    question please certainly one moment for
    our next
    question and our next question comes
    from the line of a area from Bank of
    America Securities your question
    please uh thanks for taking my question
    uh P I'm curious now that we are here
    into uh the generative AI deployments uh
    what's your view on how uh Cloud
    customers are thinking about capex
    between traditional and AI servers
    because when we look at the revenue
    growth across your GPU uh competitors
    they seem to be capturing nearly all of
    the incremental capex and you know in in
    some cases even more than um right just
    the capex of the public Cloud company so
    does that really leave much room for
    your uh CPU business to grow uh right
    Beyond just the seasonal uh variations
    so just how are you looking at the AI
    Market overall and uh what part of that
    is Intel really able to capture when we
    just look at how much is being or uh
    needing to be dedicated to your GPU
    competitors yeah thank you and you know
    let's just maybe three different aspects
    to it the first one is clearly you know
    the high-end cloud guys and what they're
    doing for maximizing training
    environments you know clearly that's
    been an accelerator market so far but
    that even is giving uh uh I'll say a bit
    of a Tailwind uh in the sense there are
    lots of head nodes associated with that
    uh we do think as we've said that the
    market moves much more from high-end
    training to inferencing of where our
    product line is uh more substant
    uh for it but the Enterprise Market as
    we see it for data centers is very much
    going to be an on premise play taking
    advantage of entrancing in that data
    pools that they already have and that's
    an area of good strength for Intel and
    we're starting to see that in some of
    the conversations with our OEM customers
    and as I finished uh you know probably
    50 meetings between World economic forum
    and Davos and CES with customers I'll
    say we have absolute unanimous uh
    response that they're going to be
    deploying a lot of their AI on premise
    in their data centers and you know zons
    and our on premise offerings are simply
    the preferred way for them to be taking
    advantage of those capabilities uh
    inside of their Data Centers inside of
    the TCO envelopes power networking
    management that they have uh in place
    obviously we need to be participating
    more in the accelerator piece of that uh
    and we're seeing uh the growing pipeline
    of our opportunity unities we saw a nice
    uptick in Revenue in Q4 from a small
    number but a lot of momentum as we come
    into the year and uh gudy 3 is getting a
    lot of excitement you know clearly
    leaving in TCO so we're going to be
    competing much more for that high-end
    accelerator uh footprint but I think the
    message of 2024 is going to be
    inferencing AI everywhere that's going
    to be at the edge that's going to be the
    aipc and it's going to be in the
    Enterprise data center all areas that
    Intel has a much stronger footprint V do
    you have a follow-up question yes uh
    thank you John thank you p uh so on the
    um Foundry side I think you mentioned um
    ifs uh you know some declines in uh q1
    after the strong Q4 that you had so I
    was hoping if it could just help us size
    what what is ifs in q1 and then longer
    term um you know you mentioned now you
    have four uh 18a wins but how do we
    quantify what they mean for 24 or 25 or
    26 and I think on the call you had
    mentioned somewhere about $10 billion in
    in lifetime uh wins uh I'm hoping that
    that's what you meant for 18a uh but
    when I look at that $10 billion over
    multiple years uh that is not really
    that big relative to I think the 130
    billion plus annual uh Foundry market so
    could you just help us size what does
    Intel's um external Foundry business
    mean for you know 2024 or 2025
    perspective thank you yeah and the two
    things in the Q4 to q1 numbers in ifs
    one is the uh I'll say the the natural
    ending of our traditional packaging uh
    volume so that affects uh Q4 as we go
    into q1 and obviously our Focus there is
    in doing I'll say traditional uh uh
    packaging you know that's best supplied
    by osat vendors but we were in a unique
    position to help our customers as we
    went through the covid uh cycle all of
    our packaging Focus going forward is
    Advanced packaging where our technology
    is differentiated the margins are good
    and as you saw we just announced the New
    Mexico facility as the first major
    Advanced manufacturing facility on us
    soil a lot of excitement from that from
    uh customers uh across the world um also
    we had our uh you know Foundry Equipment
    business uh which was another Factor Q4
    to q1 very consistent with the profile
    that you might have heard from people
    like asml right as they saw the quarter
    to quarter implications on the uh uh
    equipment business so I'll say Q4 to q1
    all explainable in those contexts the
    business we're winning 18a Foundry
    customers Intel 3 packaging you know it
    takes quarters for that to materialize
    and for way for customers years that's
    why we said lifetime deal value is
    probably the best metric that we can
    give you to help you understand the
    nature of that business as it's growing
    as I said we saw a big uptick uh from
    our prior update to this one obviously
    we need to as your question suggests get
    to a much bigger number and uh that's
    exactly what we're going to do you know
    we're now well underway we're seeing
    Healthy Growth and lifetime deal value
    we'll be giving you periodic updates on
    it as a good metric of seeing how
    rapidly that business is uh growing for
    us and i' emphasize that number is just
    external Foundry right you know our
    internal uh business is what's going to
    be driving the factory buildout and uh
    that really gives us the scale to then
    start adding these additional external
    customers to it those uh deals as we say
    they could be you know a year or two or
    they could be multiple years in length
    they'll be a varying uh uh contract
    length Associated uh with them and you
    know we just want to give you know some
    visibility transparency to the business
    and a rapidly growing lifetime deal
    value is a good way for us to give you
    some characterization of that business
    Outlook finally I want to see you
    February 21st we're going to hold a big
    industry ecosystem event our ifs Direct
    Connect and uh meeting with the
    ecosystem our customers but we're
    inviting analysts to listen in to the
    great conversations we're going to have
    and the disclosures that we'll be giving
    there thanks Jonathan can we have time
    for one more question please certainly
    one moment for our final question for
    today and our final question for today
    comes from the line of CJ muse from
    caner Fritz Gerald your question please
    yeah good afternoon thank you for
    squeezing me and I'll uh combine both my
    questions into one um typically you know
    in in a manufacturing transition you
    take on one maybe maybe two kind of
    technical challenges here at at&a you
    know you're you're taking on backside
    power gate all around and high Anda so
    would love to hear kind of maybe some of
    the struggles you've seen how you've
    worked through them and you know what
    kind of feedback you're getting from
    customers uh in in all three of those uh
    and and kind of the confidence on
    delivering the goods in the timeline
    that you set out thank you very good so
    uh let me uh uh characterize a little
    bit more carefully because we've been
    trying to carefully manage the risk that
    we're taking on so first was the move
    into euv we began that with Intel 4 and
    Intel 3 and those as we said are high
    volume manufacturing underway done so we
    sort of took the risk of euv off the
    table there uh backside power right we
    ran an internal node something we didn't
    disclose to external Foundry customers
    but we ran you know many many Wafers
    using Intel 3 with backside Power to Go
    drisk backside power before we put it
    into Intel 20a and Intel 18a so we had a
    major step to drisk Backside power and
    then of course gate all around the
    transistor so 18a brings those two
    together backside power and the gate
    allaround transistor but I'll tell you
    you know as we've been going through uh
    the development process backside power
    on ATA has been elegant beautiful high
    yield very clean in its introduction
    into the uh process and really the focus
    has been on the new transistor structure
    with gate all around as customers are
    taking advantage of that now as they're
    starting to look at that they're really
    seeing great benefits from backside
    power in some cases almost as much
    performance benefit benefit and
    significant area benefit from that and
    gate allaround transistors making good
    progress our uh 0.9 pdk that we
    delivered in Q4 and we'll be having the
    1.0 pdk in Q2 on track and as I said
    Clearwater Forest is you know the first
    product uh and it's now in Fab on at& a
    huge milestone for us both on the
    product side as well as on the process
    side highend the next generation of euv
    is not part of 18a right that will be
    part of the next major node we'll talk
    more about that at the Intel Foundry day
    as you said on February 21st but we're
    not introducing that as a risk factor in
    18a you know it's the euv tools that are
    in uh production today that we've
    already drisk as part of the Intel 4 and
    Intel 3 so we think we've done a very
    careful management of risk and uh we
    look at this all the time as we're
    rebuilding our momentum and as I said
    overall we are confident five nodes in
    four years this was audacious it's been
    superbly executed and we are on track to
    deliver it and get back to process uh
    technology uh leadership for both our
    products as well as to establish a major
    Foundry opportunity for the industry
    rebuilding Western Supply chains the
    momentum we're seeing in our whole
    Factory Network you know this is really
    incredible to progress and I couldn't be
    proud of our team for getting it
    done so with that you know let me say
    thank you for joining us on the call as
    always you know we appreciate the
    opportunity that we have to update you
    on a strong Q4 beating on top and bottom
    line finishing an incredible year in
    2023 and we're just excited about the
    momentum we see across the business for
    both our products our business and
    financial execution the manufacturing
    technology Foundry design WIS really
    across the board you our s do ratio has
    been uh extremely high and we appreciate
    the interest and as I said we we look
    forward to the opportunity to give you
    some more updates as part of Foundry uh
    Direct Connect February 21st in San Jose
    and I hope to see many of you there as
    we uh lay out an exciting uh update to
    the industry and uh it'll be a great day
    for us thank you so much for joining
    us thank you ladies and gentlemen for
    your participation in today's conference
    this does conclude the program you may
    now just connect good day
