# Dragon Springs 龙泉寺
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Springs

## Conflict with surrounding communities
Dragon Springs is a point of contention within Deerpark and the surrounding communities. Falun Gong adherents living in the area have claimed that they have experienced discrimination from local residents and from the local government based on their race and religious beliefs.[7]

In 2014 the town of Deerpark took Dragon Springs Buddhist, Inc. to court over persistent illegal construction in the Dragon Springs compound. The organization has a history of breaking local laws and then paying the associated fines without complaint.[17]

In 2018 Dragon Springs Buddhist, Inc. was fined $7,500 since they failed to comply with a local construction law requiring the installation of a sprinkler system for wooden building over four stories tall. They were also issued with a stop work order for the illegal eighth floor of the permitted seven floor wood building.[17]

In 2019, Falun Gong filed for permits to expand the site, wishing to add a 920-seat concert hall, a new parking garage, a wastewater treatment plant and a conversion of meditation space into residential space large enough to bring the total residential capacity to 500 people. These plans met with opposition from the Delaware Riverkeeper Network [18] and other environmental non-profits and citizens groups regarding the wastewater treatment facility and the elimination of local wetlands, impacting local waterways such as the Basher Kill and Neversink River.[19][20] Local residents opposed the expansion because it would increase traffic and reduce the rural character of the area in addition to the negative environmental effects.[7][21] The public hearing meeting lasted over 3 hours with a substantial number of speakers expressing their views on the proposed action.[22]

After visiting in 2019, Junker noted that "the secrecy of Dragon Springs was obvious and a source of tension for the town." Junker added that Dragon Springs's website says its restricted access is for security reasons and that the site claims the compound contains orphans and refugees.[23]

In January 2022 residents and the non-profit NYenvironcom sued, alleging Dragon Springs violated the Clean Water Act.[24]

During construction in 2008, a 54-year-old man from Toronto, Janin Liu, died in a fall. He was a volunteer construction worker rather than an employee, so no investigation was initiated by Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). No autopsy was performed because of religious preferences of the family.
