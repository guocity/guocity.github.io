# Google Hardware Efford on AI

- Google has developed a family of AI hardware, its Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), for processing AI in its server computers²³.
- Google is experimenting with designing its chips using machine learning algorithms in place of some of the human design effort². This process may help Google reduce costs and produce more efficient designs².
- Google's hardware products are designed with AI at the core, allowing them to improve over time through automatic software updates¹.
- Google's hardware business is just getting started, and they're committed to building and investing for the long run¹.

These efforts represent a kind of virtuous cycle, where AI makes chips better, and then those improved chips boost the power of the AI algorithms². This is part of Google's vision of how AI will change how people use computers¹.
