    Thank you, Mitch, and good afternoon to all those listening in today.

    We finished 2023 strong as data center sales accelerated significantly throughout the year, despite the mixed demand environment.

    As a result, we delivered record data center segment annual revenue and strong top line and bottom line growth in the fourth quarter, driven by the ramp of instinct AI accelerators and robust demand for Epic Server CPUs across cloud, enterprise, and AI customers.

    Looking at our financial results, fourth quarter revenue increased 10% year over year to $6.2 billion, driven by significant double digit percentage growth in our data center and client segments.

    On a full year basis, annual revenue declined 4% to $22.7 billion as record data center and embedded segment annual revenue was offset by lower client and gaming segment revenue.

    Importantly, data center and embedded segment annual revenue grew by $1.2 billion and accounted for more than 50% of revenue in 2023 as we gained server share, launched our next generation instinct AI accelerators, and maintained our position as the industry's largest provider of adaptive computing solutions.

    Turning to the fourth quarter business results, data center segment revenue grew 38% year over year and 43% sequentially to a record $2.3 billion.

    Server CPU and data center GPU sales both set quarterly and annual revenue records as sales of our data center products accelerated throughout the year.

    We gained server CPU revenue share in the quarter, driven by significant double digit percentage growth in fourth gen Epic processor revenue and demand for our third gen Epic processor portfolio.

    In cloud, while the overall demand environment remains soft, server CPU revenue increased year over year and sequentially as North American hyperscalers expanded fourth gen Epic processor deployment to power their internal workloads and public instances.

    Amazon, Alibaba, Google, Microsoft, and Oracle brought more than 55 AMD powered AI, HPC, and general purpose cloud instances into preview or general availability in the fourth quarter.

    During 2023, there were more than 800 Epic CPU based public cloud instances available.

    We expect this number to grow in 2024 based on the leadership performance, efficiency, and features of our Epic CPU portfolio.

    In enterprise sales accelerated by a significant double digit percentage in the quarter as we built momentum with Forbes 2000 customers.

    We closed multiple wins with large financial, energy, automotive, retail, technology, and pharmaceutical companies, positioning us well for continued growth based on expanded production deployments planned for 2024.

    A growing number of customers are adopting Epic CPUs for inferencing workloads where leadership throughput performance delivers significant advantages on smaller models like Lama 7B as well as to power head nodes in large training and inference clusters.

    Looking ahead, customer excitement for our upcoming turn family of Epic processors is very strong.

    Turn is a drop in replacement for existing fourth gen Epic platforms that extends our performance, efficiency, and TCO leadership with the addition of our next gen Zen 5 core, new memory expansion capabilities, and higher core counts.

    Internal and end customer validation work is progressing to plan with turn on track to deliver overall performance leadership as well as leadership on a per core or per watt basis across a wide range of workloads when it launches later this year.

    Turning to our broader data center portfolio, our data center GPU business accelerated significantly in the quarter with revenue exceeding our 400 million expectation driven by a faster ramp for MI 300X with AI customers.

    We launched our MI 300 accelerator family in December with strong partner and ecosystem support from multiple large cloud providers, all the major OEMs, and many leading AI developers.

    MI 300X GPUs deliver leadership generative AI performance by combining our high performance CDNA 3 architecture with industry leading memory bandwidth and capacity.

    Customer response to MI 300 has been overwhelmingly positive and we are aggressively ramping production to support the dozens of cloud, enterprise, and supercomputing customers deploying instinct accelerators.

    In cloud we are working closely with Microsoft, Oracle, Meta, and other large cloud customers on instinct GPU deployments powering both their internal AI workloads and external offerings.

    For enterprise customers, HPE, Dell, Lenovo, Supermicro, and other server vendors are on track to launch differentiated MI 300 platforms later this quarter with strong demand from multiple enterprise customers.

    In HPC supercomputing, we shipped the majority of AMD Instinct MI 300A accelerators for the El Capitan supercomputer in the fourth quarter and expect to complete shipments this quarter for what is expected to be the world's fastest supercomputer when it comes online later this year.

    We also closed new Instinct GPU wins in the quarter including the flagship system at the German high performance computing center HLRS as well as what is expected to be one of the world's most powerful enterprise supercomputers for energy company ENI.

    On AI software development, we made significant progress expanding the ecosystem of AI developers working on AMD platforms with the release of our ROCUM6 software suite.

    The ROCUM6 stack significantly increases performance in key generative AI workloads, adds expanded support and optimizations for additional frameworks and libraries, and simplifies the overall developer experience.

    The additional functionality and optimizations of ROCUM6 and the growing volume of contributions from the open source AI software community are enabling multiple large hyper scale and enterprise customers to rapidly bring up their most advanced large language models on AMD Instinct accelerators.

    For example, we are very pleased to see how quickly Microsoft was able to bring up GPT-4 on MI 300X in their production environment and roll out Azure private previews of new MI 300 instances aligned with the MI 300X launch.

    At the same time, our partnership with Huggingface, the leading open platform for the AI community, now enables hundreds of thousands of AI models to run out of the box on AMD GPUs and we are extending that collaboration to our other platforms.

    Looking ahead, our prior guidance was for data center GPU revenue to be flat ish from Q4 to Q1 and exceed $2 billion for 2024.

    Based on the strong customer pull and expanded engagements, we now expect data center GPU revenue to grow sequentially in the first quarter and exceed $3.5 billion in 2024.

    We have also made significant progress with our supply chain partners and have secured additional capacity to support upside demand.

    Turning to our client segment, revenue was $1.5 billion, an increase of 62% year over year and flat sequentially.

    We launched our latest generation Ryzen 8000 series notebooks and desktop processors in January, including our Ryzen 8040 mobile series that combined leadership compute performance and energy efficiency with an updated MPU that delivers up to 60% more AI performance compared to our prior generation that was already industry leading.

    Acer, ASUS, HP, Lenovo, MSI and other large PC OEMs will all offer notebooks powered by our Ryzen 8000 series processors with the first systems expected to go on sale in February.

    To further our leadership in AI PCs, we launched our Ryzen 8000 series processors earlier this month which are the industry's first desktop CPUs with an integrated AI engine.

    Millions of AI PCs powered by Ryzen processors have shipped to date and Ryzen CPUs power more than 90% of AI enabled PCs currently in market.

    Our work with Microsoft and our PC ecosystem partners to enable the next generation of AI PCs expanded significantly in the quarter.

    We are aggressively driving our Ryzen AI CPU roadmap to extend our AI leadership including our next gen Strix processors that are expected to deliver more than 3x the AI performance of our Ryzen 7040 series processors.

    Strix combines our next gen Zen 5 core with enhanced RDNA graphics and an updated Ryzen AI engine to significantly increase the performance, energy efficiency and AI capabilities of PCs.

    Customer momentum for Strix is strong with the first notebooks on track to launch later this year.

    Looking at 2024, we are planning for the PC TAM to grow modestly year on year weighted towards the second half as AI PCs ramp.

    We continue to see strong growth opportunities for our client business as we ramp our current products, extend our AI PC leadership and launch our next wave of Zen 5 CPUs.

    Now turning to our gaming segment, revenue declined 17% year over year and 9% sequentially to 1.4 billion as lower semi-custom revenue was partially offset by increased sales of Radeon GPUs.

    Semi-custom SOC sales declined in line with our projections in the quarter.

    Going forward, we now expect annual revenue to decline by a significant double digit percentage year over year as supply caught up with demand in 2023 and we enter the fifth year of what has been a very strong console cycle.

    In gaming graphics, revenue grew both year over year and sequentially driven by strong demand in the channel for both our Radeon 6000 and Radeon 7000 series GPUs.

    We expanded our Radeon 7000 GPU series with the launch of new RX 7600 XT series enthusiast desktop GPUs earlier this month that offer leadership price performance for 1080p gaming.

    We also launched new open source FidelityFX Super Resolution 3 software that can deliver significantly higher gaming frame rates on both GPUs and APUs.

    Turning to our embedded segment, revenue decreased 24% year over year and 15% sequentially to 1.1 billion as customers focused on reducing their inventory levels.

    We expanded our embedded portfolio in the quarter with new leadership solutions for key markets.

    We launched new Versal Prime adaptive SOCs for the aerospace, test and measurement, healthcare and communications markets that deliver industry first support for DDR5 memory and increased DSP capability compared to our prior generation.

    In automotive, we launched new Versal SOC solutions that bring industry leading AI compute capabilities and advanced safety and security features to next generation vehicles.

    We also launched rise in embedded processors with unmatched performance and features for industrial automation, machine vision, robotics and edge server applications.

    Looking at 2024, we expect overall embedded demand will remain soft through the first half of the year as customers continue to focus on normalizing their inventory levels.

    In our term, we're very confident in the growth trajectory of our embedded business as our expanded product portfolio drove more than 10 billion of design wins in 2023, an increase of more than 25% compared to 2022.

    In summary, I'm very pleased with our fourth quarter and full year results.

    For 2024, we expect the demand environment to remain mixed with strong growth in our data center and client segments offset by declines in our embedded and gaming segments.

    Against this backdrop, we believe we will deliver strong annual revenue growth and expand gross margin driven by the strength of our instinct, epic and rise in product portfolios.

    Taking a step back, we believe AI is a once in a generation transition that will reshape virtually every portion of the computing market, starting in the data center and then expanding into PCs and across multiple embedded markets.

    We have built excellent customer traction based on the strength of our multi-year AI hardware and software roadmaps, and we see clear opportunities to drive our next wave of growth as we deliver leadership AI solutions across our portfolio.

    In the data center, we see 2024 as a start of a multi-year AI adoption cycle with the market for data center AI accelerators growing to approximately $400 billion in 2027.

    Customer deployment of our instinct GPUs continues accelerating, with MI 300 now tracking to be the fastest revenue ramp of any product in our history and positioning us well to capture significant share over the coming years based on the strength of our multi-generation instinct GPU roadmap and open source ROCUM software strategy.

    In PCs, we are focused on delivering our long term roadmaps with leadership rise in AI and PU capabilities to enable differentiated experiences as Microsoft and our other software partners bring new AI capabilities to PCs starting later this year.

    At the same time, we are rapidly driving leadership AI compute capabilities across the full breadth of our embedded product portfolio.

    This is an incredibly exciting time for the industry and an even more exciting time for AMD as our leadership IP, broad product portfolio and deep customer relationships position us well to deliver significant revenue growth and earnings expansion over the next several years.

    Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter and full year financial results.

    Jean?

    Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone.

    I'll start with a review of our financial results and then provide our current outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2024.

    AMD executed well in 2023 despite of mixed market demand environment, delivering revenue of $22.7 billion and the earnings per share of $2.65.

    We drove year-over-year revenue growth in our embedded and data center segments.

    In addition, we successfully launched our AMD Instinct IMI 300 GPUs positioning us the first strong ramp in 2024 in the AI market.

    For the fourth quarter of 2023, revenue was $6.2 billion.

    Growing 10% year-over-year as revenue growth in the data center and the client segments was partially offset by the lower revenue in our embedded and gaming segments. revenue was up 6% sequentially, primarily driven by the ramp of AMD Instinct GPUs across several leading customers and higher revenue from Epic server processors, partially offset by the decline in embedded and gaming segment revenues.

    Growth margin was 51% flat year-over-year with higher revenue contribution from the data center and the client segments offset by lower embedded segment revenue.

    Operating expenses were $1.7 billion and an increase of 8% year-over-year as we invested in our AMD and marketing activities to support our significant AI growth opportunity.

    Operating income was $1.4 billion representing a 23% operating margin.

    This increased expense and other was $163 million.

    For the fourth quarter of 2023, diluted earning per share was $0.77 and an increase of 12% year-over-year.

    Now turning to our reputable segments.

    Starting with the data center segment, revenue was $2.3 billion, up 38% year-over-year and 43% sequentially, driven by strong growth of both AMD Instinct GPU and the fourth generation AMD Epic CPU sales.

    Data center segment operating income was $666 million, or 29% of revenue, compared to $444 million or 27% a year ago.

    Operating income was primarily due to operating leverage driven by higher revenue.

    Client segment revenue was $1.5 billion, up 62% year-over-year driven by Ryzen 7000 series CPU sales.

    Client segment operating income was $55 million, or 4% of revenue, compared to an operating loss of $152 million a year ago driven by higher revenue.

    Gaming segment revenue was $1.4 billion, down 17% year-over-year and 9% sequentially due to a decrease in semi-customer revenue, partially offset by increase in Ray-Dian GPU sales.

    Client segment operating income was $224 million, or 16% of revenue, compared to $266 million, or 16% a year ago.

    In better segment revenue was $1.1 billion, down 24% year-over-year and 15% sequentially, as customers continue to work down their inventory levels.

    In better segment operating income was $461 million, or 44% of revenue, compared to $699 million, or 50% a year ago.

    Turning to the balance sheet and the cash flow, during the quarter we generated $381 million in cash from operations, and the free cash flow was $242 million.

    We decreased the sequentially by $94 million to $4.4 billion.

    At the end of the quarter, cash equivalence and short-term investment was strong at $5.8 billion.

    In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2 million shares and returned $233 million to shareholders.

    For the year, we repurchased 10 million shares and returned $985 million to shareholders.

    We have $5.6 billion in remaining shares repurchased authorization.

    Now turning to our fourth quarter of 2024 outlook, we expect revenue to be approximately $5.4 billion plus or minus $300 million.

    Sequentially, we expect data center segmented revenue to be flat, with a seasonal decline in server sales offset by strong data center GPU ramp.

    And better revenue to decline as customers continue to work down their inventory levels.

    Client segmented revenue to decline seasonally and in the gaming segment.

    As we enter the fifth year of what has been a very strong gaming cycle and given current customer inventory levels, we expect revenue to decline by a significant double-digit percentage.

    Over the year, we expect data center and client segmented revenues to increase by strong double-digit percentage, giving the strength of our product portfolio and share gain opportunities.

    In-bite segmented decline and gaming segmented revenue to decline by significant double-digit percentage.

    In addition, we expect the first quarter Nangap growth margin to be approximately 52 percent.

    Nangap operating expenses to be approximately $1.73 billion.

    Nangap effective tax rate to be 13 percent and the diluted share account is expected to be approximately $1.63 billion shares.

    While we are not providing specific full-year guidance for 2024, let me provide some color.

    Only for the year, we expect 2024 data center and the client segmented revenue to increase driven by the strength of our product portfolio and share gain opportunities.

    In-bite segmented revenue to decline and gaming segmented revenue to decline by significant double-digit percentage.

    We expect to expand growth margin in 2024 and continue to invest to address the large AI opportunities while driving operating model leverage to deliver earnings per share growth faster than top-line revenue growth.

    In closing, we delivered solid financial results in 2023, further strengthening our product portfolio and establishing ourselves as a leading provider of data center GPUs for AI.

    We are very well positioned to build on this momentum and deliver strong financial performance in 2024 and beyond.

    With that, I'll turn it back to Mitch for the Q&A session.

    Thank you, Jane.

    John, we're happy to pull the audience for questions.

    Thank you, Mitch.

    We will now be conducting a question and answer session.

    If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad.

    A confirmation tone will indicate that your line is in the queue.

    You may press star two if you'd like to remove a question from the queue.

    For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys.

    We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.

    Thank you.

    One moment, please, while we pull for questions.

    And the first question comes from the line of Aaron Rackers from Wells Fargo.

    Please proceed with your question.

    Yeah, thanks for taking the question.

    Just kind of framing the outlook and the guidance for this calendar first quarter, I guess the first question is, can you help us on a relative basis the $400 million of data center GP revenue that you expected in Q4?

    What that ultimately kind of fell out to be?

    And then on the guidance into Q1, can you help us appreciate what seasonal is defined as as we think about the server business into the Q1 guide?

    Sure, Aaron.

    Let me start and then see if Jane has something to add.

    So relative to the data center GP business, we were very pleased with providing the data performance that we saw in the fourth quarter.

    It was always going to be a very sort of back-end quarter weighted as we were ramping the product.

    And we saw MI300A, our HPC product actually ramp very well.

    And then we saw MI300X, the AI product actually exceed our expectations based on strong customer demand, the way the qualifications went, and then the manufacturer ramp.

    So we were over $400 million for that business in the fourth quarter.

    And then going into the first quarter, as we look at the business, server seasonality, call it something around, let's call it high single digit, low double digit.

    There are also some other pieces of the data center business.

    I think the key piece of it is we had originally expected the ramp to be a little bit more shallow of our MI300X.

    And what we're seeing now is the supply chain is operating really well and the customer demand is strong.

    And so we will see MI300X increase as we go into the first quarter.

    And things are going relatively well.

    Yeah, Erin, I'll give you some color.

    Erin, I'll give you some color about client seasonality and others.

    So client is very similar to server.

    Q1 is high single digit to low double digit.

    That's consistent with the past.

    On the embedded side, it's very consistent with what we said in the past and consistent with what you see in the industry.

    Embedded business is going through a bottoming process.

    And we think of Q1, it will have a low double digit sequential decline.

    That's embedded.

    On the gaming side, Lisa mentioned during her prepare remarks, we have the late stage of product cycle in the year five of gaming console.

    But at the same time, we also have inventory at the customers.

    So the combination of those impact, we expect the Q1 gaming sequential declines probably more than 30%.

    So hopefully that'll help you a little bit.

    Yeah.

    Very helpful, Gene.

    And as a quick follow up, I'm just curious, the traditional server demand that you see, I know when we look at server CPU, shipments are down north of 20% year over year.

    Are you seeing any signals or how are you thinking about a recovery in that traditional, call it non-AI general purpose server market as we move through 24?

    Sure, Erin.

    So look, I think I agree with your characterization of the 2023 demand.

    So we did see some strong progress in the second half of the year, especially as customers in cloud and enterprise adopted our Genoa and our ZenFour family.

    So going into 2024, I would say the traditional server market is probably still mixed, especially into the first half of the year.

    There's still some cloud optimization going on as well as enterprise being a little bit cautious.

    During the case though, we also see opportunities for us to continue to grow share in the traditional server business.

    I think our portfolio is extremely strong.

    The adoption of Genoa and Bergamo as well as our new Sienna product lines are getting a lot of traction.

    And then we also see Turin, our ZenFive product coming in the second half of the year.

    So even in a mixed demand environment, I think we're bullish on what traditional server CPUs can do in 2024.

    And the next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.

    Please proceed with your question.

    Thanks a lot.

    Lisa, I'm wondering if you can give us a little bit of sense in terms of the milepost that you're kind of marching toward on this $400 billion tan that you have for 2027.

    For example, do you think you can gain share at a rate that's kind of similar to the rate that you gain share for server CPU?

    Or I guess maybe asked a different way, is it reasonable to kind of look at your consumer GPU share of 20 plus percent?

    Is that a reasonable bogey or do you have aspirations higher than that perhaps?

    Yeah, thanks Tim for the question.

    You know, I would say a couple things.

    First of all, we're really pleased with the progress that we've made in our data center GPU business.

    I think the ramp that we've seen, the customer traction that we've seen even in the last few months I think has been great and that gives us a lot of confidence in the ramp of this business.

    I think the beauty of the AI market here is it's growing so quickly that I think we have both the market dynamic as well as our ability to gain share in that framework.

    The point I will make is our customer engagements right now are all quite strategic, dozens of customers with multi-generational conversations.

    So as excited as we are about the ramp of MI 300 and frankly there's a lot to do in 2024, we're also very excited about the opportunities to extend that into the next couple of years out into that 25, 26, 27 timeframe.

    So I think we see a lot of growth.

    I think it's a little early to make market share projections but I would say it's a significant growth driver given the market demand as well as our own product capabilities.

    Thanks a lot.

    Gene, I guess as a follow-up, I know that you don't want to guide the full year but I'm wondering if I can pin you down just to touch on maybe a mile post that you're marching to for 2024 growth is up 20% for the whole company.

    Is that a reasonable target?

    And then I guess within data center, if you just add the incremental data center GPU revenue and you assume that the server business grows a little bit, it seems like that should maybe double year over year but I'm kind of wondering if you can give us any ranges on those numbers.

    Thanks.

    Hi, Tim.

    Thank you for the question.

    Yeah, we're not guiding a year.

    It's very early of the year, literally January.

    I think the way to think about it is Lisa mentioned during her prepared remarks, we feel pretty good about both our data center and client business to grow in 2024.

    Of course, the largest incremental revenue opportunities are going to come from data center between both the server side, the Ganymalshere and the data center GPU side with a significant ramp of our MI 300.

    I think that's how we think about it.

    We do have a headwind from gaming segment.

    We do think a year over year will see very significant double digit decline on the gaming segment and at the same time embedded, it's going through the bottoming process.

    We do think a second half will see the recovery.

    So those are the puts and the takes.

    I can talk about it.

    And the next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsey with TD Cowan.

    Please proceed with your question.

    Thank you very much.

    Good afternoon.

    Lisa, I wanted to ask, there's been so much focus and scrutiny as there should be on the really exciting progression with MI 300.

    We've progressed over the last six months from, I think, some doubts in the investment community to software and your ability to ramp the product.

    And now you've proven that you're ramping it with, I think you said, dozens of customers across different end markets.

    So what I'm interested in hearing a little bit more about and you guys have been open about what some of the forward programs in your traditional server business look like from a roadmap perspective, I'd be interested to hear how you're thinking about the roadmap in your MI accelerator family.

    Is it going to continue to be parts that are CPU and GPU together?

    Is it primarily a GPU only roadmap?

    What kind of cadence are you thinking about?

    Just be any kind of color you can give us on.

    Some of the forward roadmap trajectory for that program would be really helpful.

    Thanks.

    Yeah, sure, Matt.

    So I appreciate the comments.

    I think the traction that we're getting with the MI 300 family is really strong.

    I think what's benefited us here is our use of chiplet technologies, which has given us the ability to have both the APU version as well as the GPU version.

    We continue to use that to differentiate ourselves and that's how we get our memory bandwidth and memory capacity advantages.

    As we go forward, you can imagine like we did in the Epic timeframe, we planned multiple generations in sequence.

    That's the way we're planning the roadmap.

    One of the things I will note about the AI accelerator market is the demand for compute is so high that we are seeing sort of an acceleration of the roadmap generations here and we are similarly planning acceleration of our roadmap.

    I would say that we'll talk more about the overall roadmap beyond MI 300 as we get into later this year, but you can be assured that we're working very closely with our customers to have a very competitive roadmap for both training and inference that will come out over the next couple of years.

    Thank you for that, Lisa.

    Just as a follow-up, I guess one of the questions that I've been getting a lot in different forums is with respect to the $400 billion TAM that you guys have laid out for 2027.

    If you could give us a little look under the hood, I guess I've got a hundred versions of the same question, which is how the heck did you come up with that number?

    If you could give us a little bit more in terms of are we talking about systems and accelerator cards?

    Are we talking about just the silicon?

    Are we talking about full servers?

    What kind of unit assumptions, any kind of thing that you can give us on market sizing or what gives you the visibility so early into this generative AI trend to give a precise number of three years out, that would be really, really helpful.

    Thank you.

    Sure.

    Well, Matt, I don't know how precise it is, but I think we said approximately $400 billion, but I think what we need to look at is growth rate and how do we get to those growth rates.

    I think we expect units to grow, substantial double-digit percentage, but you should also expect that content is going to grow.

    So if you think about how important memory and memory capacity is as we go forward, you can imagine that we'll see acceleration there and just the overall content as we go to more advanced technology nodes.

    So there's some ASP uplift in there.

    And then what we also do is we're planning longer-term roadmaps with our customers in terms of how they're thinking about the size of training clusters, the number of training clusters, and then the fact that we believe inference is actually going to exceed training as we go into the next couple of years, just given as more enterprises adopt.

    So I think as we look at all of those pieces, I think we feel good that the growth rate is going to be significant and sustained over the next few years.

    In terms of what's in that TAM, it really is accelerator TAM.

    So within accelerators, there are certainly GPUs and there will also be some ASICs that are or other accelerators that are in that TAM.

    As we think about the different types of models from smaller models to fine-tuning of models to the largest, large-language models, I think you're going to need different silicon for those different use cases.

    But from our standpoint, GPUs are still going to be the compute element of choice when you're talking about training and inferencing on the largest language models.

    And the next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.

    Please proceed with your question.

    Great.

    Thank you.

    I think you talked about the MI 300 cloud workloads being kind of split between the more customer-facing workloads versus internal.

    Can you talk about how you see the breakdown of that and how is your ecosystem progressing?

    This is a brand new chip.

    It seems impressive that you're able to support kind of a broad range of customer-facing workloads in cloud.

    Yeah, sure, Joe.

    So yes, look, we are really happy with how the MI 300 has come up.

    And we've now deployed and working with a number of customers.

    What we have seen is certainly Rockham 6 has been very important, as well as the direct optimization with our top cloud customers.

    We always said that the best way of optimizing the software is working directly on the most important workloads.

    And we've seen performance come up nicely, which is what we expect, frankly, with the GPU capabilities that we would have to do some level of optimization, but that optimization has gone well.

    I think to your broader question, the way I look at this is there are lots of opportunities for us to work directly with large customers, both on the cloud side as well as on the enterprise side, who have specific training and inferencing workloads.

    Our job is to make it as easy as possible for them.

    And so our entire tool chain, all of our overall Rockham Suite has really gone through significant progress over the last six to nine months.

    And then we're also getting some nice support from the open source community.

    So the work that Huggingface is doing is tremendous in terms of just real-time optimization on our hardware, our partnership with OpenAI on Triton, and our work across a number of these open source models has helped us actually make very rapid progress.

    Great.

    And from my follow-up, I guess a lot of the forecasting of your business that I'm hearing is coming from supply chain, and we're sort of hearing AMD's building X in Asia.

    I guess, how would you ask us to think about that?

    Are you looking at being kind of sold out for the year, and so the supply chain would be close to revenue?

    Are you building for the best case scenario?

    Just, I worry about sometimes expectations when people hear these supply chain numbers, and I'm just curious how you would bridge the gap.

    Yeah.

    So, I mean, Joe, I think we updated our revenue expectations this quarter from our original number of $2 billion to $3.5 billion to try to give some bounding on some of the discussion out there.

    The way to think about the $3.5 billion is these are customers that we're working with who have given us firm commitments on what they need.

    As you know, the lead times on these products are quite long, so it's important to have those forecasts in early, and we have a strong order book, so that gives us good confidence to exceed the $3.5 billion.

    From a supply chain standpoint, our goal is always to build more supply, and so from that standpoint, we have also worked with our supply chain partners and secured significant capacity.

    Think about it as first half capacity is tight, and more comes on in the second half of the year, but we've certainly made more progress there, so we do have more supply, and we're going to continue to work with our customers on their deployments, and we'll update that number as we go through the year.

    And the next question comes from the line of Toshia Hari with Goldman Sachs.

    Please proceed with your question.

    Hi, thank you for taking the question.

    I had one on the MI 300 as well, Lisa.

    I guess first of all, how should we think about the quarterly trajectory beyond Q1?

    You talked about Q1 being up sequentially.

    Is it fair to assume kind of a straight line as we progress through the balance of the year, or is it more second half skewed?

    How should we think about that?

    And I guess more importantly, some of the cloud potential customers that have yet to officially sign up for sign off on the MI 300, I guess what's the sticking point?

    Is it just a function of time, and you just need a little bit more time to go back and forth and tweak things?

    Is there a software kind of concern?

    I guess what's holding them back at this point?

    Yeah, Toshia, thanks for the question.

    So first on the MI 300 trajectory, I think you would expect that revenue should increase every quarter from now through sort of the end of the year, but it will be a bit more second half-weighted.

    And part of that is just customers finishing up their qualifications in their lines, as well as sort of how our supply chain is ramping.

    So yes, it should increase each quarter, but be a bit more second half-weighted.

    And then to your comment about customers, look, we're engaged with all of sort of the large customers.

    These are all folks that know us really well, given our deep relationships and Epic.

    I think people just have different adoption cycles as they consider what they're trying to do in their roadmap.

    But I view this as still very, very early innings for us in this space.

    And I think a question was asked earlier.

    I think the key is this is not just about an MI 300 conversation, but it really is about sort of our long-term multi-generational roadmap.

    And so that's the context on which we're working with our largest customers, as well as, as you know, there's a lot of demand coming from folks that are more AI centric and not necessarily typical cloud customers, but more enterprise or, you know, let's call it AI-specific companies that we're also very well engaged with.

    Got it.

    That's super helpful.

    And then as my follow-up, maybe one for Gene on the gross margin side, you're guiding Q1 to 52%.

    I'm curious, again, I'm sure you're not going to give quantitative guidance beyond Q1, but how to think about the trajectory for Q2 and beyond.

    I'm pretty sure you're working through some kinks as it pertains to the instinct ramp.

    Hopefully that improves over time.

    So that should be a tailwind.

    FPGAs, perhaps the second half, you know, turns for the better.

    And you've got server CPU volume go throughout the year.

    So it feels like you've got multiple tailwinds as we think about gross margin progression on a sequential basis.

    But what are the potential headwinds as we move throughout 2024?

    Thank you.

    Yeah, Toshia, thank you for the question.

    Yeah, you're absolutely right.

    We have some puts and takes that impact our gross margin.

    We guided the Q1 120 basis point higher than Q4 sequentially, primarily because the higher data center contribution actually more than offset the decline of embedded business in Q1.

    Going forward, the way to think about it is, as you said, the major driver is going to be data center business is going to grow much faster than other segment.

    That makes change will help us to expand the gross margin nicely.

    I think you also are spot on on the embedded coming back in second half, which will be a tailwind with the data center GPU.

    We are at the very early stage of ramp.

    We are improving testing time yield and continue to expand the gross margin.

    We expect to be creative to corporate averages.

    Those are all the tailwinds coming in the second half.

    I would say the headwinds aside continue to be in the first half where we see embedded business not only Q1, we see sequential decline.

    Q2 probably are going to be sequentially flat tissue versus Q1.

    That is a headwind for us because it does have a very nice gross margin.

    Overall, we feel pretty good about the trajectory of the gross margin improvement, especially second half.

    The next question comes from the line of Ross Seymour with Deutsche Bank.

    Please proceed with your question.

    Thanks for the question.

    I wanted to get into the competitive environment.

    First on the instinct side of things, how that is going.

    It does not seem to be slowing down your ramp whatsoever.

    Then also on the straight server CPU side of things, Lisa, you said you are gaining share in that area.

    As we think about future roadmaps, pricing incentives, those sorts of things, any meaningful change in the competitive environment that you are seeing throughout the 2024?

    Sure, Ross.

    I think the environment for us is always competitive.

    I think that has not changed.

    If I look at the instinct side, I think we have shown that MI 300 and our road map are actually very competitive.

    There are some places where, let's call it, it is more even in the training environment, but as we look at the inferencing environment, we think we have significant advantages.

    That is shown through in some of our customer work.

    We think for both training and inference, we will continue to be very competitive.

    Then as you go into the CPU side, again, from our view, with each generation of Epic, we have continued to gain share.

    I think we have exited the fourth quarter at record share for AMD.

    We are still quite underrepresented in enterprise.

    I think there is an opportunity for us to continue to gain share as we go through 2024.

    From a competitive standpoint, what we see is Zen 4 is extremely competitive right now with Genoa, Bergamo, Sienna.

    As we go into Turin, we are deep in the design in cycle for Zen 5 and Turin, and we feel very good about how we are positioned.

    Thanks for that.

    I guess this is my follow-up.

    The data center side, another theme that has been pervasive throughout 2023 at least, was the GPU side crowding out the CPU side.

    You mentioned that there is still a little bit of cloud digestion going on within your Epic business, but where do you see that standing?

    I know you are going to gain share, et cetera, but you guys have clearly benefited from the Instinct side, the data center GPU side.

    What about on the CPU side of things?

    Is that Edwin now behind us, or is it still an issue?

    I think we expect the CPU business from a market standpoint to grow, Ross, as we go into 2024.

    I think the rate and pace of growth will depend a little bit on the macro and just overall CAPEX trends.

    From our standpoint, we are starting to see some of our larger customers plan their refresh cycles.

    There is a lot of what is called older equipment that has yet to be refreshed.

    The value proposition for refresh is so strong because the energy efficiency and the footprint of the newer generations are so much better than the four or five-year-old infrastructure that we do see that refresh cycle happening as we get into 2024.

    I think the exact timing will have to understand more as the market evolves as we go through the year.

    The next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities.

    Please proceed with your question.

    Thanks for telling my questions.

    First one, Lisa, you gave us a 2 billion plus number for MI before.

    Now you have raised it to over 3.5 billion.

    I am curious what drove the change?

    Was it incremental demand signals?

    Was it supply?

    Can you supply more if let's say demand is 4 or 5 or 6 billion?

    What is the limitation?

    Related to that on the competition side, your competitor will launch their B100 later in the year.

    Do you think that will change the competitive landscape in any way?

    Yes, sure Vivek.

    I think what we said is as we went from 2 to 3.5 billion, it really is mostly customer demand signals.

    As orders have come on books and as we have seen programs move from what is called pilot programs into full manufacturing programs, we have updated the revenue forecast.

    As I said earlier, from a supply standpoint, we are planning for success and so we worked closely with our supply chain partners to ensure that we can ship more than 3.5 billion substantially more depending on what customer demand is as we go into the second half of the year.

    In terms of roadmaps, as I said, we are very focused on a competitive roadmap that is what the next generations are beyond MI 300.

    I do believe that we have a strong roadmap in place and continue to work with our customers to adopt our roadmap as quickly as possible.

    And a longer-term question, if I look at the success that AMD has enjoyed, it is many factors, but a few of them included your early adoption of chiplets and then the strong partnership we have had with TSMC.

    But now we are seeing your x86 competitor Intel also adopt chiplet or Tile technology as they call it.

    And then I think recently the manufacturing update they gave, they said they are 2 years ahead in terms of incorporating gate all around and back side delivery.

    So let's assume they are right and they have either caught up to TSMC or maybe they are ahead.

    What impact does that have on AMD in kind of the medium to longer term?

    Yeah, sure.

    In fact, look, we are always looking at what is next.

    So on the chiplet technology, we are sort of on the fourth generation of the chiplet technologies.

    I think we have learned a lot about how to optimize performance there.

    We are very aggressive with our adoption of leading edge technology as it is needed.

    But I think those are only a few of the pieces.

    We are also focused on continuing to innovate on architecture and design.

    So I think the longer-term question that you ask is, I think we are expecting that the competition is going to be on a similar process technology.

    And even in that case, I think we feel like we have a very strong roadmap going forward and we will continue to drive both the CPU and the GPU roadmap very aggressively.

    And the next question comes from the line of Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler.

    Please proceed with your question.

    Yeah, hey, thanks for letting me ask a question, guys.

    I had two questions.

    Let me start off with the accelerator side.

    The question we get a lot from our customers is they want to understand the value proposition of the MI 300.

    So Lisa, I was hoping you could give us some understanding of price versus power comparison or compute power.

    And then today, are you seeing your customers that are buying the MI 300?

    Are they primarily buying it for inferencing today or are they using it primarily for tooling?

    And maybe for Gene, Gene, do you think is it possible for MI 300 to finish the year at a run rate of about $1.5 billion?

    Okay, Harsh.

    So let me start.

    Your question about the value proposition for MI 300.

    Again, customers are using it for different reasons, but presume that there is a performance per dollar benefit to using AMD.

    So that's one piece of it.

    The other piece of it, though, is we intrinsically have more memory bandwidth and memory capacity on MI 300X compared to the competition.

    And what that means is for large language models that are many tens of billions of parameters, you could potentially do the workload in fewer GPUs.

    So it's a substantial system savings and allows you to do much more work within the same system.

    In terms of what customers are using MI 300 for today, I would say there are a number of customers using it for large language model inferencing.

    And there are also customers that are using it for training.

    So I think the whole point is being a strong partner.

    When you quit these AI systems in place, they are sometimes mixed use systems, so they would be used for both training and inference.

    John, we have time for two more questions.

    Yeah.

    Harsh, let me answer your question about the MI 300.

    In 2018 Q4 2024, is it possible to get to 1.5?

    It is possible, right?

    Because Lisa mentioned earlier, we'll see sequential increase each quarter and the mall back and loaded in second half.

    And we do have a supply more than 3.5 billion.

    And of course, we'll continue to make progress with our customers.

    So the math, yeah, it's possible.

    But right now, we are really looking at focusing on the execution over the current 3.5 billion plus.

    And the next question comes from the line of Stacy Raskin with Bernstein Research.

    Please proceed with your question.

    Hi, guys.

    Thanks for taking my questions.

    For the first one, you had talked about that you had expected a more shallow ramp of the MI 300 and it's clearly doing better than that.

    So if some of the upside, I guess, in the near term, is that being pulled forward from the second half?

    Or is this like a step up?

    Or is it more of a step up and demand both in the first set than the second half relative to what you were seeing before?

    Like, how do I interpret that as a shallow comment that you made?

    Sure, Stacy.

    I don't think it's a pull forward of demand.

    I think what it is is, you know, we wanted to see how long it would take for customers to fully qualify and get their workloads performance.

    So, you know, that depends a lot on, you know, the actual engineering work that's done.

    And now that we're, you know, let's call it a quarter later, we've seen that it's gone really well.

    So it's actually gone, you know, a bit better than our original forecast.

    And as a result, we've seen stronger demand signals and, you know, customers are gaining confidence in their ability to deploy a significant number of MI 300s this year.

    Got it.

    Thank you.

    Now, follow up.

    I want to ask Matt's question a little more directly.

    You didn't quite answer it.

    The $400 billion number that you've got out there, is that just silicon in chips or is there hardware and servers and stuff like that in that number as well?

    Like, what's in that number?

    Yeah, I thought I had answered it, but yes, I'll answer it again.

    It is accelerator chips.

    It is not systems.

    So think of it as, you know, GPUs, you know, ASICs that will, you know, be there, sort of those types of things.

    But it includes, obviously, it includes, you know, memory and other things that are packaged together with the GPUs.

    Yeah, memory will be quite significant, right?

    So memory is a big portion of it too.

    The final question comes from the line of Chris Danly with Citi.

    Please proceed with your question.

    Hey, thanks for squeezing me in, team.

    I guess question for Lisa.

    As MI 300 revenue ramps, how do you see the customer concentration, let's say, a year or two from now?

    Do you think you'll have one or two customers that are in double digits or one or two that are half the revenue, or do you think it'll be totally fragmented?

    I don't think it'll be one or two that are half the revenue, Chris.

    I think we're building this as a, you know, really, we're happy to see, you know, sort of the broad adoption.

    As always with, you know, sort of the large cloud, you know, partners, we might see, you know, sort of one or two that are higher than others, but I don't think you see the type of concentration that you mentioned.

    Great.

    And then just to follow up on somebody else's question on, you know, sort of Intel's roadmap versus TSMC.

    So I'm sure you're intimately familiar with TSMC's manufacturing roadmap, and we've all seen Intel open up the kimono on what they expect to happen over the next couple of years.

    I mean, do you think Intel's going to close the gap somewhat with your founder over the next couple of years?

    Do you think they'll be able to maintain the lead?

    You know, I feel very good about our partnership with TSMC.

    They continue to execute extremely well.

    You know, we'll see what happens over the next, you know, a few years.

    But you know, I'd like to kind of re-emphasize what I said earlier.

    You know, even in the case of, you know, process parity, we feel very good about our architectural roadmap and, you know, all of the other things that we add as we look at our entire portfolio of CPUs, GPUs, DPUs, adaptive SOCs, and kind of put them together to solve problems.

    I think we feel really good about what we can do with our customers.

    So, you know, we're always going to be paying attention to, you know, sort of the process race.

    But I think we feel very good about, you know, sort of our strategy and how do we continue to sort of push the envelope on the computing roadmaps.

    Okay.

    And that is the end of the question and answer session.

    I would like to turn the floor back over to the AMD team for any closing comments.

    Great, John.

    That concludes today's call.

    Thank you to everyone for joining us today.

    And this concludes today's teleconference.

    You may disconnect your lines at this time.

    Thank you for your participation.
