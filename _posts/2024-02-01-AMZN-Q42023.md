# Amazon Earning Call Summary

- **Amazon Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript**: This is a transcript of a conference call where Amazon executives discussed the financial results of the fourth quarter of 2023, which ended on December 31st, 2023.
- **Revenue Growth**: Amazon reported net sales of $149.2 billion, up 12% year-over-year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates. The growth was driven by strong customer demand, especially during the holiday season, across various categories and geographies.
- **Operating Income and Net Income**: Amazon reported operating income of $2.7 billion, which was negatively impacted by $2.7 billion of charges related to employee severance, impairments of property and equipment and operating leases, and changes in estimates for self-insurance liabilities. Net income was $278 million, which included a $2.3 billion valuation loss from the investment in Rivian Automotive.
- **AWS Performance**: AWS net sales increased 20% year-over-year to $21.4 billion, representing an annualized run rate of over $85 billion. AWS growth was slowed by customer optimization efforts in response to the economic downturn, which are expected to continue for at least the next couple of quarters. AWS still has a healthy and robust customer pipeline and a leading position in the cloud market.

# Amazon Guidance

- Amazon reported $170 billion in revenue, up 13% year-over-year, and $13.2 billion in operating income, up 383% year-over-year, for Q4 2023, exceeding the guidance range and setting a new quarterly record.
- Amazon's stores business saw strong customer demand, driven by the broadest selection, the best prices, and the fastest delivery speeds ever. Amazon delivered more than 7 billion items to Prime members in the same or next day in 2023, and reduced the cost to serve per unit globally for the first time since 2018.
- Amazon's advertising business grew 26% year-over-year, primarily driven by sponsored ads and the launch of new products like sponsored TV, which allows brands to create streaming TV campaigns with self-service tools.
- AWS revenue grew 13% year-over-year to $24.2 billion, accelerating from Q3 and approaching a $100 billion annual run rate. AWS added more than $1.1 billion in incremental revenue quarter-over-quarter, and signed new agreements with customers like Salesforce, BMW, Nvidia, and LG. AWS also launched new products and services in the generative AI space, such as Bedrock, Q, and Tranium 2, which are seeing rapid adoption and revenue growth.
- Amazon continued to invest in newer businesses that have the potential to be important to customers and Amazon long term, such as Project Kuiper, which aims to provide broadband connectivity to underserved areas, and Prime Video, which had a successful second season of Thursday Night Football and plans to launch more exclusive content for Prime members.
- Amazon expects to increase its capital expenditures in 2024, mainly to support the growth of AWS and its generative AI initiatives, as well as to add incremental capacity for its fulfillment and transportation network, especially for same-day delivery and automation.
- Amazon also announced a change in the useful life of its servers from five years to six years, which will have a positive impact on its operating income of about $900 million in Q1 2024.

# Amazon Gen AI Stack
- **Compute layer**: This is where customers who are building their own models run training and inference on compute instances that use different types of chips, such as Nvidia, Tranium, or Inferentia. Amazon offers the most expansive collection of compute instances with custom AI chips that offer faster performance and lower cost than alternatives.
- **Model layer**: This is where customers can leverage an existing large language model, such as Bedrock, and customize it with their own data and features. Bedrock is a managed service that makes it easy to experiment and iterate on generative AI applications with the security and reliability of AWS. Bedrock also offers a variety of models from Amazon and other providers, such as Anthropic, Coheir, Meta, Stability AI, and more.
- **Application layer**: This is where customers can use generative AI applications that are built on top of the model layer, such as Q, Rufus, or others. Q is an expert work assistant that can write code, debug code, test code, translate code, query data, answer questions, summarize data, carry on a conversation, and take action. Rufus is an expert shopping assistant that can answer shopping journey questions, provide recommendations, explain features, and retain context. These applications are designed to improve customer experiences and productivity with generative AI.


# Amazon AI Software
- Amazon is investing in generative AI (Gen AI), which is a type of AI that can create new content or data based on existing models and data.
- Amazon has three distinct layers in the Gen AI stack: the compute layer, where customers can run their own models on various chips; the model layer, where customers can use Bedrock, a managed service for large language models; and the application layer, where customers can use Q, a coding companion, and Rufus, a shopping assistant.
- Amazon is building dozens of Gen AI applications across its businesses, and believes that Gen AI will drive tens of billions of dollars of revenue for Amazon over the next several years.
- Amazon is also expanding its Project Kuiper, a low earth orbit satellite initiative that aims to provide broadband connectivity to underserved areas, and its Prime Video business, which offers exclusive content and streaming TV advertising.

# Amazon AI Hardware
- Amazon has built custom AI training chips named Tranium and inference chips named Inferentia, which offer faster performance and more memory capacity than alternatives.
- Amazon also offers the most expansive collection of compute instances with Nvidia chips for customers who are building their own models and running training and inference on compute.
- Amazon is increasing the useful life of its servers from five years to six years, which will have a positive impact on its operating income and capital expenditures.

# Amazon Satellite
- The project is called **Kuiper**, and it aims to provide **broadband connectivity** to the 400 to 500 million households who don't have it today.
- In October 2023, Amazon launched **two end-to-end prototype satellites** into space and successfully validated all key systems and subsystems.
- Amazon was able to make a **two-way video call**, stream a **prime video movie** in ultra HD 4k, and make an **Amazon purchase** over its end-to-end communication network.
- Amazon is on track to launch its **first production satellites** in the first half of 2024 and start **beta testing** in the second half of the year.


# Amazon Q4 2023 Earnings Call Full Transcript

Good day everyone and welcome to the Amazon.com fourth quarter 2023 financial results teleconference.

At this time all participants are in a listen only mode.

After the presentation we will conduct a question and answer session.

Today's call is being recorded.

For opening remarks I will be turning the call over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr.Dave Files.

Thank you sir.

Please go ahead.

Hello and welcome to our Q4 2023 financial results conference call.

Joining us today to answer your questions is Andy Jassy, our CEO and Brian Olsavsky, our CFO.

As you listen to today's conference call we encourage you to have our press release in front of you which includes our financial results as well as metrics and commentary on the quarter.

Please note unless otherwise stated all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of 2022.

Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's use as of today, February 1st 2024 only and will include forward-looking statements.

Actual results may differ materially.

Additional information about factors that could potentially impact our financial results is included in today's press release and our filings with the SEC including our most recent annual report on Form 10K and subsequent filings.

During this call we may discuss certain non-gap financial measures and our press release, slides accompanying this webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website.

You will find additional disclosures regarding these non-gap measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable gap measures.

Our guidance incorporates the order trends that we've seen today and what we believe today to be appropriate assumptions.

Our results are inherently unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors including fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic and geopolitical conditions and customer demand and spending including the impact of recessionary fears, inflation, interest rates, regional labor market constraints, world events, the rate of growth of the internet, online commerce, cloud services and new and emerging technologies and the various factors detailed in our filings with the SEC.

Our guidance assumes among other things that we don't conclude any additional business acquisitions or structurings or legal settlements.

It's not possible to accurately predict demand for our goods and services and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.

And now I'll turn the call over to Andy.

Thanks Dave.

Today we're reporting 170 billion in revenue up 13 percent year-over-year excluding the impact from foreign exchange rates, 13.2 billion in operating income up 383 percent year-over-year 10.5 billion and 35.5 billion in trailing 12-month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases up 48.3 billion year-over-year.

While we've made meaningful progress in our financial measures what we're most pleased about is the continued customer experience improvements across our businesses.

These results represent a lot of invention, collaboration, discipline, execution, adjusting and reimagining from teams across Amazon.

Looking back at Q4 I'll start with our stores business where customers responded to our continued focus on selection price and convenience.

We continue to have the broadest retail selection with hundreds of millions of products available and added tens of millions of new items last year alone including fashion selection from Coach, Victoria's secrets fashion, Pid Viper and Beyonce's Renaissance Tour merch to cosmetics from Lancome, Urban Decay cosmetics and No Beauty by Vanessa Hudgens to consumer technology and services from Boost, Infinite and Woop to Homewares from Martha Stewart.

Being sharp on price is always important but particularly in an uncertain economy where customers are careful about how much they're spending.

We kicked off the holiday season with Prime Big Deal Days an exclusive event for Prime Members to provide an early start on holiday shopping.

This was followed by our extended Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday shopping event which was open to all customers and ended up being our largest event ever.

These events also helped attract new customers and Prime Members.

Throughout the quarter customers saved nearly 10 billion dollars across millions of deals and coupons almost 70 percent more than last year.

In addition to offering great deals we continue to improve delivery speeds.

In 2023 Amazon delivered to Prime Members at the fastest speeds ever with more than seven billion items arriving same or next day including more than four billion in the US and more than two billion in Europe.

In the US this result is the combination of two things.

One is the benefit of regionalization where we rearchitected the network to store items closer to customers.

The other is the expansion of same day facilities where in the US in the fourth quarter we increased the number of items delivered the same day or overnight by more than 65 percent year-over-year.

As we're able to get customers items this fast it increases the number of occasions that customers choose Amazon to fulfill their shopping needs and we can see that in all sorts of areas including how fast our everyday essentials business is growing.

Our regionalization efforts have also brought transportation distances down which has helped lower our cost to serve.

In 2023 for the first time since 2018 we reduced our cost to serve on a per unit basis globally and the US alone cost to serve was down by more than 45 cents per unit compared to the prior year.

Lowering cost to serve allows us not only to invest in speed improvements but also afford adding more selection at lower average selling prices or ASPs and profitably.

We have a saying that it's not hard to lower prices it's hard to be able to afford lowering prices.

The same is true with adding selection it's not hard to add lower ASP selection it's hard to be able to afford offering lower ASP selection and still like the economics.

Like improving speed adding selection puts us in the consideration set for more purchases.

As we look toward 2024 and beyond we're not done lowering our cost to serve.

We've challenged every closely held belief in our fulfillment network and reevaluated every part of it and found several areas where we believe we can lower cost while also delivering faster for customers.

Our inbound fulfillment architecture and resulting inventory placement are areas of focus in 2024 and we have optimism there's more upside for us.

Alongside our store's business our advertising growth remains strong up 26 percent year-over-year which is primarily driven by our sponsored ads.

We've recently added sponsored TV to this offering in the U.S. a self-service solution for brands to create streaming TV campaigns with no minimum spend putting this advertising within reach of any business.

While still early days streaming TV advertising continues to grow quickly.

Brands are using our capabilities to reach engaged viewers on Twitch, Free V, Fire TV and prime video shows and movies which just launched in the U.S. as well as Thursday night football.

Shifting to AWS revenue in the quarter grew 13 percent year-over-year in Q4 versus 12 percent year-over-year in Q3 and we're now approaching an annualized revenue run rate of a hundred billion dollars.

We watched the incremental revenue added each quarter and in Q4 AWS added more than one point one billion dollars in incremental quarter over quarter revenue which in a FX neutral basis is more than any other cloud provider as far as we can tell.

While cost optimization continued to attenuate larger new deals also accelerated.

Evidence by recently inked agreements with Salesforce, BMW, Nvidia, LG, Hyundai, Merc, MUFG, Axiota, Cathay, BYD, Accor, Amgen and SAIC.

Our customer pipeline remains strong as existing customers are renewing at larger commitments over longer periods and migrations are growing. 2023 also was a very significant year of delivery and customer trial for generative AI or Gen AI in AWS.

You may remember that we've explained our vision of three distinct layers in the Gen AI stack each of which is gigantic and each of which we're deeply investing.

At the bottom layer where customers who are building their own models run training and inference on compute where the chip is the key component in that compute we offer the most expansive collection of compute instances with Nvidia chips.

We also have customers who would like us to push the price performance envelope on AI chips just as we have with Graviton for generalized CPU chips which are 40% more price performance than other x86 alternatives and as a result we've built custom AI training chips named Tranium and inference chips named Inferentia and re-event we announced Tranium 2 which offers four times faster training performance and three times more memory capacity versus the first generation of Tranium enabling advantageous price performance versus alternatives.

We already have several customers using our AI chips including Anthropic, Airbnb, Hugging Face, Qualtrics, Rico and Snap.

In the middle layer where companies seek to leverage an existing large language model customize it with their own data and leverage AWS security and other features all as a managed service we've launched Bedrock which is off to a very strong start with many thousands of customers using the service after just a few months.

The team continues to rapidly iterate on Bedrock recently delivering capabilities including guardrails to safeguard what questions applications will answer, knowledge bases to expand models knowledge base with retrieval augmented generation or RAG and real-time queries, agents to complete multi-step tasks and fine-tuning to keep teaching and refining models all of which will help customers applications be higher quality and have better customer experiences.

We also added new models from Anthropic, Coheir, Meta with Lama 2, Stability AI and our own Amazon Titan family of LLMs.

What customers have learned at this early stage of Gen AI is that there's meaningful iteration required in building a production Gen AI application with the requisite enterprise quality at the cost and latency needed.

Customers don't want only one model they want different models for different types of applications and different size models for different applications.

Customers want a service that makes this experimenting and iterating simple and this is what Bedrock does which is why so many customers are excited about it.

At the top layer of the stack is the application layer one of the very best early Gen AI applications is a coding companion.

At re-invent we launched Amazon Q which is an expert on AWS writes code Debugs code, test code, does translations like moving from an old version of Java to a new one and can also query customers various data repositories like intranets, wikis or from over 40 different popular connectors to data in Salesforce, Amazon S3, ServiceNow, Slack, Neglassian or Zendesk among others and answer questions summarize this data carry on a coherent conversation and take action.

It was designed with security and privacy in mind from the start making it easier for organizations to use Gen AI safely.

Q is the most capable work assistant in another service that customers are very excited about.

By the way don't underestimate the point about Bedrock and Q inheriting the same security and access control as customers get with AWS.

Security is a big deal and an important differentiator between cloud providers.

The data in these models is some of companies most sensitive and critical assets.

With AWS's advantage security capabilities and track record relative to other providers we continue to see momentum around customers wanting to do their long-term Gen AI work with AWS.

We're building dozens of Gen AI apps across Amazon's businesses several of which have launched and others of which are in development.

This morning we launched Rufus an expert shopping assistant trained on our product and customer data that represents a significant customer experience improvement for discovery.

Rufus lets customers ask shopping journey questions like what is the best golf ball to use for better spin control?

For which are the best cold weather rain jackets and get thoughtful explanations for what matters and recommendations on products?

You can carry on a conversation with Rufus on other related or unrelated questions and it retains context coherently.

You can sit through our rich product pages by asking Rufus questions on any product features and it'll return answers quickly.

We're at the start of what Rufus will do with further personalization and expansion coming but we're excited about how it'll make discovery even easier on Amazon.

Gen AI is and will continue to be an area of pervasive focus and investment across Amazon primarily because there are few initiatives if any that give us the chance to reinvent so many of our customer experiences and processes and we believe it'll ultimately drive tens of billions of dollars of revenue for Amazon over the next several years.

In addition to our stores and AWS businesses we continue to make progress on newer business investments that have the potential to be important to customers in Amazon long term touching on two of them.

In October we had a major milestone in our journey to commercialized project Kuiper which is our low earth orbit satellite initiative that aims to provide broadband connectivity to the 400 to 500 million households who don't have it today.

We launched two end-to-end prototype satellites into space and successfully validated all key systems and subsystems.

Made a two-way video call, streamed a prime video movie in ultra HD 4k and made an Amazon purchase over our end-to-end communication network.

It's rare to be able to exercise all these elements in an initial launch like this.

We're on track to launch our first production satellites in the first half of 2024 and start beta testing in the second half of the year.

We've still got a long way to go but are encouraged by our progress.

During the quarter we also completed our second season of Thursday Night football which was a rousing success by all accounts.

The customer experience continued to improve as our talent, production, streaming quality, analytics and unique AI features like Prime Vision and Defense of the Lords all took big leaps forward on top of their very good start last year.

We launched a new NFL tradition with the inaugural Black Friday football game and our continuous innovation resonated with viewers as the number of people watching increased 24% year-over-year and with advertisers as we made dramatic year-over-year gains and ad sales.

We have increased in conviction that Prime Video can be a large and profitable business on its own and will continue to invest in compelling exclusive content for Prime members like Thursday Night football, Go To The Rings, Reacher, Mr. and Mrs.

Smith, Citadel and more and with the additional ads in Prime Video we'll be able to continue investing meaningfully in content over time.

I'll close by reiterating that 2023 was a really good year and I'm grateful to all of our teams who delivered on behalf of customers.

Yet I think every one of us at Amazon believes this is just the start of what's possible.

We have a long way to go in every one of our businesses before we exhaust how we can make customers' lives better and easier and there is considerable upside in each of the businesses in which we're investing.

With that I'll turn it over to Brian.

Thanks, Andy.

Overall we saw strong performance in the fourth quarter.

Worldwide revenue was $170 billion representing an increase of 13% year-over-year excluding the impact of foreign exchange and approximately $3 billion above the top end of our guidance range.

So our highest quarterly worldwide operating income ever which was $13.2 billion for the quarter an increase of $10.5 billion year-over-year and $2.2 billion above the high end of our guidance range.

For the full year 2023 we had a meaningful improvement across our financial results.

Revenue was $574.8 billion an increase of 12% year-over-year excluding the impact of foreign exchange.

Operating income tripled year-over-year to $36.9 billion.

Trelley 12-month free cash flow adjusted for equipment finance leases was $35.5 billion up $48.3 billion versus last year.

These financial outputs are a result of a lot of improvements in our key input metrics such as stores cost to serve which decreased year-over-year for the first time since 2018 and in our ability to deliver to customers at our fastest speeds ever.

I want to thank our customers our partners and our teammates around the world for a very strong 2023 performance.

Focusing on the fourth quarter North America revenue was $105.5 billion an increase of 13% year-over-year and an acceleration of 200 basis points compared to Q3.

International revenue was $40.2 billion an increase of 13% year-over-year excluding the impact of foreign exchange also an acceleration of 200 basis points compared to Q3.

During the quarter we remain focused on the inputs that matter most to our customers price selection and convenience.

Our shopping events throughout the quarter included prime big deal days in October and our extended Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping event helped to attract new prime members and deliver billions in savings for customers.

We made meaningful progress on delivery speeds in the United States and globally which helped strong sales throughout the quarter including notable strength in the last minute gifting for our ability to provide fast shipping helped our prime members ensure that they got their gifts before the holidays.

These improvements in delivery speed have led to increased purchase frequency by our prime members across all of our major geographies.

It also strengthened demand for our everyday essentials categories like beauty and health and personal care where speed is even more important to customers.

Third-party sellers were a big part of our success over the holidays with worldwide third-party seller services revenue growing at 19% year-over-year excluding the impact of foreign exchange and worldwide third-party seller unit mix was 61% its highest level ever.

We also saw strong performance in worldwide advertising which grew 26% year-over-year excluding the impact of foreign exchange.

This strength in advertising was primarily driven by sponsored products as our teams work hard to increase the relevancy of the ads we show customers by leveraging machine learning.

Advertising only works if the ads are helpful to customers and there's a lot of value in tailoring sponsored products so they are relevant to what a customer is actually searching for.

We're also continually focused on improving our measurement capabilities which allow brands to see the payback of their advertising spend.

Shifting the profitability North America segment operating income was $6.5 billion an increase of $6.7 billion year-over-year resulting in an operating margin of 6.1% up 120 basis points quarter-over-quarter.

Since North America operating margins were at their recent low levels in Q1 of 2022 we have now seen seven consecutive quarters of improvement resulting in a cumulative improvement of 800 basis points over these past seven quarters.

In addition to the strong top-line growth which helped to drive improved leverage throughout our businesses we continue to make progress on reducing our cost to serve.

The fourth quarter is our busiest time of year supported by an increasingly large and integrated operations network.

Overall our teams executed extremely well yielding strong efficiency gains with minimal disruptions.

We were pleased with the performance of our regionalized network during the holiday period but we saw benefits from improved inventory placement helping drive faster speeds and also lowering costs.

We also continue to see benefits from lower transportation rates which include line haul ocean and rail and from a more stable labor market resulting in improved staffing levels.

In our international segment we are now operating loss of $419 million an improvement of $1.8 billion year-over-year.

This improvement was primarily driven by lowering our cost to serve through increased units per box, lower transportation rates and leverage across our fixed costs as we continue to focus on customer inputs and improve efficiencies within our operations.

The international segment represents more than 20 countries of varying degrees of growth and our largest established countries like the UK, Germany and Japan relatively strong revenue growth contributed to the year-over- year improvement and profitability.

Additionally we saw good progress in our emerging countries as they continue to expand their customer offerings while seeking to invest wisely.

Moving to AWS revenues were $24.2 billion an increase of 13% year-over-year.

On a quarter over quarter basis we added more than $1.1 billion of revenue in AWS as customers are continuing to shift their focus towards driving innovation and bringing new workloads to the cloud.

Similar to what we shared last quarter we continue to see the diminishing impact of cost optimizations and as these optimizations slow down we're seeing more companies turning their attention to newer initiatives and re-accelerating existing migrations.

Customers are also excited about our approach to generative AI.

Still relatively early days but the revenues are accelerating rapidly across all three layers and our approach to democratizing AI is resonating well with our customers.

We have seen significant interest from our customers wanting to run generative AI applications and build large language models and foundation models all with the privacy reliability and security they have grown accustomed to with AWS.

AWS operating income with $7.2 billion an increase of $2 billion year-over-year.

Our operating margin for the quarter was 29.6% up more than 500 basis points year-over-year and effectively flat on a quarter over quarter basis.

This margin improvement reflects our head count reductions from earlier in the year and a slowdown in the pace of hiring.

Shifting to free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis free cash flow adjusted for finance leases was $35.5 billion and improvement of $48.3 billion year-over- year.

The largest driver of the improvement in free cash flow is our increased operating income which we are seeing across all three of our segments.

We're also seeing improvements in working capital notably in inventory efficiency driven by our regionalization efforts.

Next let's turn to capital investments.

We define our capital investments as a combination of CAPX plus equipment finance leases.

In 2023 full year CAPX was $48.4 billion which was down $10.2 billion year-over-year primarily driven by lower spend on fulfillment and transportation.

As we look forward to 2024 we anticipate CAPX to increase year-over-year primarily driven by increased infrastructure CAPX.

Support growth of our AWS business including additional investments and generative AI and large language models.

One thing I'd like to highlight in our first quarter guidance is that we recently completed a useful life study for our servers and we are increasing the useful life from five years to six years beginning in January 2024.

We will have this anticipated benefit to our operating income of approximately $900 million in Q1 which is included in our operating income guidance.

As we turn the calendar to 2024 we are excited to continue upon the great work the teams have been able to deliver in 2023.

We remain focused on streamlining and prioritizing projects in an effective way that reduces costs and also allows us to continue innovating and inventing for customers.

With that let's move on to questions.

At this time we will now open the call up for questions.

We ask each caller to please limit yourself to one question.

If you would like to ask a question please press star one on your keypad.

We ask that when you pose your question you pick up your handset to provide optimum sound quality.

Once again to initiate a question please press star then one on your touchtone telephone at this time.

Please hold while we poll for questions.

Thank you.

Our first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs.

Please proceed with your question.

Thank you so much for taking the questions.

I'm just going to do a two-parter on AWS.

If we take a step back can you talk a little bit about the contribution from backlog conversion, AI workloads and some elements that allowed you to reaccelerate revenue at AWS in Q4 and that we should think about those components from an exit velocity standpoint into 2024.

And then against your broader comments on CAPEX any color on how we should be thinking about AI driven CAPEX within the AWS initiatives against the broader CAPEX commentary.

Thank you.

Yeah that's right this is Dave just to give you that figure the balance was $155.7 billion as of 1231 so that's more than $45 billion year over year and $20 billion quarter over quarter.

And then you know if you look back at the revenue growth it accelerated to 13.2 percent Q4 as we just mentioned that was an acceleration.

We expect accelerating trends to continue into 2024.

We're excited about the migrate continuous or resumption I guess of migrations that companies may put on hold during 2023 in some cases and interest in our generative AI and products like bedrock and Q as Andy was describing that on the CAPEX side let me talk in total for the company.

We had $48 billion in 2023 was down $10 billion year per year.

We talked about during the year quite a bit a lot of the mix of investment in 2023 was tied to infrastructure infrastructure mostly supporting AWS but also supporting our core Amazon businesses was about 60 percent of our spend so it reached a very high percentage.

We anticipate those trends continuing into 2024.

CAPEX will go up in 2024 I'm not giving a number today but we do and we're still working through plans for the year but we do expect CAPEX to rise as we add capacity in AWS for region expansions but primarily the work we're doing the generative AI projects.

In the fulfillment center and logistics area I would say it's more incremental capacity at this point based on additional demand although we are seeing some additional investments for same day delivery sites and automation robotics but the trend for most of the large percentage of the spend will be in the infrastructure is going to continue into 2024.

I had a few things to what Brian said I think just as it relates to the first part of the question just the way to think about backlog conversion is just these are deals that we've signed that are long-term deals typically with customers and then there's some amount of time it takes where we work with those customers to migrate those workloads and so you know some of the trends that we have seen over the last quarter you know first of all I think that the lion's share of cost optimization has happened it's not that there won't be any more or that we don't see any more but it's just attenuated very significantly and at the same time what we've seen is that migrations and this speaks to some of the backlog migrations that were you know proceeding but maybe not at the pace that we saw before started to pick up again we've also seen that a number of the deals that typically signed more quickly but we're signing more slowly in more uncertain environments you know a lot of those got done in the last quarter and you heard in my opening remarks some of the examples but that was you know some of several and we're continuing to see that trend and then you know on the gen AI side it's you know if you look at the gen AI revenue we have in absolute numbers it's a pretty big number but in the scheme of a hundred billion dollar annual revenue run rate business it's still relatively small much smaller than what it will be in the future where we really believe we're going to drive ten to billions of dollars of revenue over the next several years but it's it's encouraging how fast it's growing and and our offering is really resonating with customers and the next question comes from the line of brian noak with morgan stanley please proceed with your question great thanks for taking my questions i have two um andy the first one is sort of on the the cost to serve comments coming down for the first time since 2018 as you sort of look into 24 and 25 can you just sort of walk us through some of the key operational blocking and tackling that has to happen to continue to drive down that that cost of serve back to 2018 levels or however you're thinking about your your north star from that perspective and then the second one is one sort of philosophy about capital returns you know it looks like the cash balance could start building pretty nicely here how do you think about the idea of you know buyback share repurchases or some type of capital return program to sort of help shareholders out yeah thank you brian i appreciate i'll take the first and i'll probably take the second um you know i on the cost of serve coming down as i mentioned in my opening remarks i don't think that we feel like we're um where we're going to ultimately be you know i think we feel like we have meaningful upside there and you know i think one thing that it's easy to do to make as large a change as we made in in regionalization in the u.s. and think check you know we got that done but the reality is we still have several improvements and a bunch of ways that we can hone the regionalization improvements that we made in 2023 in 2024 and so when when when the team speaks about the areas where they believe they have opportunities there's still opportunities just in regionalization as we continue to hone that but i also think you know in many ways it was very useful for us to go through what was you know a pretty significant change we went through during the pandemic where we doubled the size of our fulfillment center center network in 18 months and built out a last mile transportation network the size of ups in 18 months it was it was disruptive to get that optimized but one of the things that was very useful was it really caused us to relook at everything we were doing with the fulfillment network and we looked at it with really a beginner's eye and we have found so many areas that we believe that we can evolve that i think will both help our costs to serve and and even more importantly deliver faster delivery speeds for customers and i mentioned you know one area which in particular which you'll see us focus on over the next year or two is just we think there are real opportunities in our inbound network and our inbound processes and then where we locate inventory and association with that which will accomplish both those tasks but you know for for us i don't believe that we believe that 2018 is the north star and cost to serve i think we believe we can keep evolving it and being better than that yeah i just had a couple other items there you know we've gotten a lot better at fixed cost controls as we scale and i think you're seeing that as part of you know our ability to lower costs for serve not only in operations it's actually throughout the company and we're you know we're seeing reduction in some of the inflationary factors that hit us in especially hard in 2021 and 2022 things like transportation or transportation services fuel and others so not totally out of the woods there but coming down and we still see some more upside on your share repurchase question first of all just really excited to actually have that question no one's asked me that in three years and appreciate it but you know we we have come through it's multiple periods where you know as annie just said we doubled the size of our just six footprint and invested heavily and you saw that negative free cash flow at least on our all-tooth calculation for the period 2021 to 2022 so we're glad to see the improvement and the bounce back in free cash flow a lot of and we do we do debate and discuss capital structure policies annually or more often and i have nothing to announce today but again we we primarily think we have a lot of strong investments in front of us we're good to have we're glad to have the liquidity better liquidity at the end of 2023 and we're going to try to continue to build that and our next question comes from the line of Doug Annmuth with JP Morgan please proceed with your question thanks for saying the questions brian you've seen very good improvement in international profitability over the last several quarters can you just talk about some of the levers here that you're thinking about just as you look to move into positive operating income and then how international could potentially approach north america levels over time and then just a follow-up there are you are you seeing any shipping disruptions currently related to the red sea and does that factor into your outlook at all for one q thanks yeah let me start with the second one first so we're mindful of the geopolitical issues around the world especially as you say in the supply chain and how that might impact shipments both to the us and to europe we're just working very hard to you know make that not back up on customers and we'll you know continue to work that it's not a material impact into the guy it's estimated in our guidance in q1 but again as i said we're vigilant on that and we'll you know work to take steps where we need to to make sure that customer experience is not impacted on the international segment operating income yeah we're very pleased with the results especially over the last few quarters we improved improved operating income by 1.8 billion dollars year-over-year and i would attribute it to the steady progress that andy was saying about the us yes again cost of service down advertising is stronger you know a lot of attention to cost a lot of attention to investments and where we're going to invest and other fixed cost controls so a lot of that is what we're seeing in the established countries of europe and japan i would divide the segment a bit into a couple buckets first there's that international segment or excuse me european established country segment and that's it behaves a lot like you would see in north america if you look at the emerging countries and we again we've launched 10 countries in the last seven years they're all on their own trajectory of you know journey to profitability and significance with customers and we're pleased with that i think they're they're all growing nicely and again leveraging their cost structure investing wisely in prime benefits but you know all on a curve to you know break even and then be a contributor to income and free cash flow the other thing i'd point out is that you know we have advanced loaded i would say prime benefits in our international markets we think it's a very good source of customer acquisition and customer retention the investment in those areas can fluctuate quarter to quarter we had a bit of a higher spend in a device excuse me in digital content in q4 as we had a number of marketing and content especially around live sports english premier league and champions league in germany and indily for example but these we like those benefits and those investments they're a proven vehicle for customer acquisition as i said and it gets people shopping on our sites and engaging with benefits is always positive for the relationship with amazon and the next question comes from the line of mark mahaney with evercore isi please proceed with your question okay thanks two questions please i think you mentioned brian that the north american margins have been approved for seven quarters in a row or something like that a significant number i would assume that most of the factors like rising capacity utilization given your capex commentary about retail the regional center efficiencies and then overall you know moderation and shipping logistics cost labor cost i mean all these factors probably mean that we'll continue to get an improvement in north american margins but if you would comment on that and then secondly on the prime time video prime amazon prime video i know it just launched but could you provide any any color context on expectations around that you've got a massive number of prime users you're coming in with a reasonable you know cpm with a low add load but it seems like there should be a substantial opportunity for you so any if you want to try to size that for us or how you think about the upside that'd be really appreciated thank you sure mark thank you um you know i think any uh laid it out pretty well a few minutes ago on the cost structure the regionalization the growing into the assets that we added during the pandemic great efficiency and work with productivity across really all of our operations network fixed attention to fixed costs and lowering costs where we can maintaining costs where we can the increase in advertising success in advertising revenue growth that's outpaced our traffic growth rates so all of those trends we expect to continue and we're going to work hard to make sure they continue and as we said you know we have a one guidepost is maybe pre-pandemic profitability but you know we are working to we're not putting a limit on our improvement we're going to you know continue to look for ways to lower the cost to serve and it might add at the same time you know increase the the customer experience because we did that we had that cost improvement at the same time when we at first got back to our shipping speeds from pre-pandemic and then exceeded them so we're happy with that and we'll continue to do both to you know improve the customer experience and also to you know lower our cost and leverage our cost structure yeah your second question on ads I can't scale it right now I mean that you know what I would say for for ads in video is that you know advertisers are excited to access our prime customer base we're looking for ways to increase our advertising and our streaming properties including you know fire tv but also and prime video but also things like freebie and twitch and you know it's an important part of the total business model and we expect it to allow us to have a healthy business to continue to invest in content and to continue to grow that and and we feel good about it and we you know the way we anticipate the ad progressing we will not have heavy ad loads relative to but then you see other other in network tv and other things and like all of our advertising we're trying to get useful for customers and our next question comes from the line of Scott debit with wedbush securities please proceed with your question thanks i have one on grocery and one on healthcare first on on grocery I was wondering if you could talk a bit about the progress that you're making in unifying the offering between dot com fresh and whole foods and and as it relates to reverse logistics and using the grocery facilities how that's lowering the cost of reverse logistics and whether you're doing a significant opportunity there in terms of driving traffic and revenue in the grocery business then secondly on healthcare in such a poor notoriously poor customer experience industry and you know you've made these significant efforts now within acquisition and offering primary care it's just be curious if you could talk a little bit more about the longer term vision in healthcare thank you yeah and grocery you know we're we're we're pleased with the progress we're making there we always think about our grocery business right now and kind of i'll call it three big macro segments you know the first is non perishables where these are things like consumables and canned goods and pet food and health and beauty products and pharmaceutical and we it's a big business and it's continuing to grow at a very healthy clip and we're really pleased with that business and it's really the way the most mass merchandise mass merchandise has got into the grocery business you know a few decades ago so that continues to grow at a very healthy clip we have a physical presence you know along with online but in Whole Foods Market which is really the pioneer and the leader in organic grocery and that's continuing to grow at a very good clip we also made a number of changes in the business last year on the profitability side where we really like the profitability trajectory we see there and so again you'll see that keep growing and expanding and feel very good about that as well if you want to serve as many grocery needs as we do you have to have a mass physical presence and that's what we've been trying to do with with fresh over several years we have tested we've been testing a v2 of our fresh format in a few locations near Chicago and a few locations in southern california it's very early it's just a few months in but the results are very promising and it on almost every dimension and so you know we need to see it for a little bit um longer time but but the results appear like we have something that's resonating and if we continue to see that then the issue becomes how fast and and what's the best way to expand we have also been spending increasing amounts of time and efforts here trying to make it easier for customers to be able to shop between you know the non perishables and then our our selection whole foods as well as fresh i think you can expect to see that over time both in the user experience you know on the app and in the website as well as how we're able to better leverage between the different business segments and their logistics capabilities being able to get better leverage there better economics and then allowing people to order in one concerted place but be able to pick up in multiple place pick up from multiple um types of grocery products in one place you're seeing us already do more of that and i think you can expect that in the future in the healthcare space you know i uh if you think about what we do on the retail side adding a pharmacy capability is a pretty natural extension it's something that customers had asked us for for for many years and it's got more complexity to it than the rest of our retail business so we just think carefully about whether we wanted to pursue it but the customer so badly wanted it and um and the experience we thought could be better and we could be a meaningful part of changing that that we pursued it and i really like the momentum that we're seeing in our amazon pharmacy business it's growing really quickly but even more important with then how fast it's growing if you've used it and you've paid attention to the customer experience over the last 12 to 15 months it's just substantially improved from where it already was pretty good it's you know people really love the experience and i think that when you know the healthcare experience particularly in the us is a pretty frustrating one and not a very good one and i think that when we tell our grandkids that the way you used to have to go get primary care was to make an appointment three weeks in advance and then drive 20 minutes to the doctor park wait in the reception for 15 minutes get put into an exam room for 15 minutes doctor comes in and talks to you talks to you for five to 10 minutes and then you got to drive 20 minutes to the pharmacy people are just not our grandkids will not believe that was the experience and it's not going to be and you already see that changing and it's part of what attracted us in such a significant way to one medical is just their their application their app is so easy to use you have all your healthcare data in one spot you can do chats with with medical practitioners you can do video calls if you need to see someone there's physical locations and lots of metropolitan cities where you can get in the same day if you need to see a specialist they're plugged into specialists and all the cities in which we operate where you can get in a day or two later like it's just it's a very different experience and if you actually need medication you can get that sent to you in a day or two either through Amazon pharmacy or other pharmacies that we work with and that experience is so much better than what we've been accustomed to seeing and so I think it's you know again still early days we're excited we launched for prime members the ability to get one medical subscription for $9 a month or $99 a year which is 50% off the typical price and that's a very good take up so it's still early days but we think we have an opportunity to be a meaningful part of changing that experience and if we are helpful in changing what that primary care experience is and what it looks like get pharmaceutical items there's a lot of things that we might be able to help customers with over time that you know whether it's wellness or whether it's diet there's a bunch of areas that I think we can help over time and our final question will come from the line of Colin Sebastian with Baird please proceed with your question thanks very much I just wanted to follow up on on AWS for a moment you outlined the generative AI stack which I think is which is very clear so I'm just curious maybe how you're going to market within the application layer given sort of the competitive dynamics of that and then maybe expand if you could Annie a little bit on the strategy for gen AI on the consumer facing side of the business and then you launched Rufus today is that an area that you think could materially improve conversion rates and the overall consumer engagement on on the retail apps or what's your what's your vision there thank you yeah so Colin I would say a few things on first on generative AI you know it's when we talk to customers particularly at enterprises as they're thinking about generative AI many are still thinking through at which layers of those three layers of the stack I laid out that they want to operate in and you know we predict that most companies will operate in at least two of them but I also think even though it may not be the case early on I think many of the technically capable companies will operate at all three they will build their own models they will leverage existing models from us and then they're going to build apps and I know one of the other interesting things that we see early on right now in generative AI is that customer you know it's a it's a very iterative process and real work to go from plugging a question into a chat bot and getting an answer to turning that into a production quality application at the quality you need for your customer experience in your reputation and then also getting that application to work at the latency and cost characteristics that you need and so what we see is that customers want choice they they don't want just one model to rule the world they want different models for different applications and they want to experiment with all different sized models because they yield different cost structures and different latency characteristics and so bedrock is really resonating with customers they just they know they want to change all these variables and try and experiment and they have something that manages all those different transitions and changes so they can they can figure out what works best for them especially in the first couple of years where they're learning how to build successful generative AI applications is incredibly important to them so it's part of why we see bedrock resonating so much in the same way what what's attractive to enterprises when they think about coding companions like Q is just if you can get 30 40 percent better productivity for your developers which in in many cases for companies is their most scarce resource it's a game changer and you know and they they don't they won't roll out every bit of code that comes from a coding companion but if it can assist them to get 80 plus the way they are quickly that's a big deal and one of the things that's unique about Q is it's not just a coding companion yes you know it's an expert on AWS it will help you you know it helps you write the code but it also helps you debug the code and helps you test the code and helps you do transformations and helps you figure out how to multi-step implement features there's a lot of you know helps you troubleshoot there's something in your application that's a rye Q can find it and help you fix it and so you know and then it also lets you look at all your data repositories whether it's intranets or wikis or you know the 40 plus data connectors like salesforce and elastian and zendesk and slack and and it lets you have an intelligent conversation to get answers and take action so it's a pretty differentiated capability there and when when enterprises are looking at how they might best make their developers more productive they're looking at what's the array of capabilities and these different coding companion options they have and so we're spending a lot of time you know our enterprises are quite excited about it it created a meaningful stir or reinvent and what you see typically is that these companies experiment with different options they have and they make decisions for their employee base and we're seeing very good momentum there the question about how we're thinking about jnai and our consumer businesses we're building dozens of generative ai applications across the company it's every business that we have has multiple generative ai applications in their building and they're all in different stages many of which have launched and others of which are in development so if you just look in our some of our consumer businesses on the retail side we you know we built a generative ai application that allowed customers to look at um summary of customer reviews so that they didn't have to read hundreds and sometimes thousands of reviews to get a sense for what people like or dislike about a product we launched a generative ai application that allows customers to quickly be able to predict what kind of fit they'd have for different apparel items we built a generative application that in our fulfillment centers the forecast how much inventory we need in each particular fulfillment center and so the the start of the rollout of roof is today is really just another step but we think one that's pretty meaningful um in in being a generative ai power shopping assistant and you know it's trained on our very expensive product catalog as well as our community q and a is a customer reviews and in the broader web but it lets customers discover items in a very different way than they have been able to on e-commerce websites so if you want buying advice like what what should i look for in a pair of headphones or if you are doing purpose buying like what should i buy for cold weather golf or comparisons you know what's the difference in lip gloss or lip oil or you want recommendations of the best valentine's day gifts or you know you're on a detailed page with rich product info where you don't want to go through the whole page you want to ask is this pickleball racket good for beginners all those questions you can plug in and get really good answers and then it's seamlessly integrated in the amazon experience that customers are used to and love to be able to take action so you know i think that that's just the next iteration i think it's going to meaningfully change what discovery looks like for our shopping experience and for our customers and i could kind of step through every one of those consumer businesses you know our advertising businesses is building capabilities where people can submit a picture and an ad copy is written and the other way around and you can kind of think about a lexa where we're building a very large expansive large language model that's going to make a lexa even more productive and helpful for customer every one of our consumer businesses has a significant number of generative ai applications that they either have built and delivered or they're in the process of building and i don't see that i don't see that changing for for many years we have a lot of ideas thanks for joining us today on the call and for your questions a replay will be available available on our investor relations website for at least three months we appreciate your interest in amazon and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter and ladies and gentlemen that those conclude today's teleconference you may disconnect your lines at this time thank you for your participation
