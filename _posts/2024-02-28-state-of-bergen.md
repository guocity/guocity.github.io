[APPLAUSE] >> The recognizing of all the board officials that are here today just come in one good job doing that.

So that saves us a little bit of time.

But I wanted to offer my 10th annual speech, State of the County report.

And I'm only the second county executive in the history of the county to be able to do the 10th year report.

[APPLAUSE] Today with us is the first person that was delivered, who was able to deliver the 10th State of the County speech.

And that's Pat Schuber and I'll have more to say about Pat.

Pat, thank you for being here.

>> [APPLAUSE] >> I'm proud to say that once again the state of Bergen County is as strong as ever.

Much of that is thanks to the devotion of our nearly 2,500 county employees who work day in and day out to serve the nearly one million residents who call Bergen County home. 2023 brought us many positive moments, accolades and accomplishments worthy of recognition.

We had record attendance and record at Winter Wonderland.

Broke round on new high school for career and technical education.

We facilitated 630,000 grants to local organizations that supported community food banks.

So our 500% increase in restitution payments to consumers from bad business actors thanks to the Bergen Consumer Affairs Division.

We hosted 320,000 play, sorry, play 320,000 rounds of golf and dispensed over 4 million golf balls at the Darlington driving range for the first time in years, I might add.

And the county animal shelter facilitated the adoption of over 1,100 animals.

>> [APPLAUSE] >> But this year was also not without some somber moments.

Since I last gave this speech one year ago, we lost our long time county farm on Fire Marshall.

Brian Hennig.

As well as several other county employees critical to our mission.

Marino, Lucas, Mark, Schoen, David, Erbsbro, Pete, Dragon, Gene, Marie, Sarah, Cole, Stanley, Jason, Lohan, Eugenia, Ford, and Laurie Hoffman.

Please join me in your bonus silence as I remember those people.

[BLANK_AUDIO] Thank you.

As you are aware, I've dedicated 48 years to volunteering as a first responder, as Tom talked about.

Throughout my tenure as county executive, I strive to embody the same drive of dedication by consistently supporting our first responders in strengthening our public safety infrastructure through policy and action.

Last March, we celebrated the completion of a three building addition to the Law and Public Safety Institute that supports regional cross-disciplinary training for fire, police, and EMS.

Replicating real life conditions that quit with a mall, a movie theater, mixed use retail and housing, and parking deck.

And several propane burners, this facility is now the ideal location for SWAT training, active shooter drills, and simulation of large scale fires.

The county administration heard from the police training commission last week, and I'm excited to say that working together with the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office, the Bergen County Sheriff's Office, and the County Police Chiefs Association, we can once again look forward to the start of the Bergen County Police class at the Law and Public Safety Institute.

This is under the new operating structure led by the county administration.

We have notified police chiefs throughout Bergen County that classes will begin sometime in March.

I want to take this opportunity to thank Deputy Administrator Kenneth Theramber for assuming the role as transitional director of the police cabinet.

[APPLAUSE] We continue to expand shared services as our communications center entered into a first of the kind agreement in New Jersey to handle all 911 and radio communications for entities outside Bergen County.

Bringing the town of Harrison and the borough of East Newark Hudson County on for 911 and full radio dispatching, we are establishing a precedent for further expansion.

Today, I am announcing Bergen County will be formulating a plan to provide 911 service for the entire county.

The plan will allow for any municipality to have Bergen County answer its 911 calls, saving those talents their yearly 911 calls.

This will establish Bergen County as a 911 regional call center for all of northern New Jersey.

We will be applying for state and federal funds to cover the cost for these expanded services. 2023 also marked the opening chapter of Bergen County's emergency medical ambulance service.

A 24/7 county point emergency medical transportation service staffed with 11 full-time emergency medical technicians, EMTs, and supplemented by 40 plus per day.

Across the state, we've seen EMS department spaces steady decline in volunteerism.

Even with local hospitals attempting to fill this gap, ambulance time and wait times are still a problem in many areas of Bergen County.

I faced this issue directly when I was the mayor of Params.

For years, the borough exceptional volunteer ambulance court faced a consistent decrease in membership, which impacted the number of ambulances on the road and ultimately response time.

When 911 is called, every second matters.

I made a tough decision to supplement the volunteer EMS ambulance operation with a paid operation.

The result, fully staffed ambulances were able to respond to more emergencies in a timely and efficient manner.

That saved lives.

This experience is what I had in mind when it came time to roll out Bergen County's EMS ambulance service.

I knew to replicate the success I had for ambulances at the county level.

In one short year, our operation has grown from having two ambulances stationed on us, ambulances on the road during peak hours, to four ambulances stationed strategically throughout the county. 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Bergen EMS ambulance is average 450 calls per month, and that number continues to increase.

The Bergen County emergency service, the emergency ambulance service is completely self-sustaining as they utilize balanced building, meaning county residents will only be billed for what their insurance covers, not a cent more.

This is only the beginning.

I envision that Bergen County's emergency ambulance service will continue to expand and will one day serve as the primary provider for emergency medical ambulance transportation in Bergen County.

As part of our commitment for Carrot Motor, Carrot for the most vulnerable among us, we continue to prioritize high quality care and services at our county hospital, Bergen New Bridge Medical Center.

The county hospital had another stellar year as they became one of only five hospitals in New Jersey to receive joint accreditation for health equity and launched an incredible community health initiative to bring quality health care to the doorstep of our residents here in Bergen County.

These new care right now health centers located in Sarah's shop rights throughout our region offer residents care at a moment's notice.

Under the leadership of CEO Deborah Fisconi, Bergen New Bridge is set in sights even higher for 2024 as they complete the expansion of the emergency department which will more than double its bed capacity, implement new robotic surgery.

Whoever thought that Bergen Pines, Bergen Refinery would have robotic surgery.

And in partnership with the county, they begin planning for the first new health building and parking garage on the campus since construction of building 14 in 1985.

We are new to the world.

[Applause] Through the efforts like new Bergen New Bridge Center for Comprehensive Addiction Treatment which provide patients with individualized evidence-based stigma-free care and the county's division of mental health and addiction services, we are working hard to ensure that those who need help are given it with the proper support and guidance.

Today, this is the brochure that New Bridge Medical Center puts out and here it is today the Comprehensive Addiction Treatment Program.

Dead, what a wonderful job.

This is especially critical because like most communities across the country, Bergen County continues to face realities of opioid epidemic.

But we, we in Bergen County are making a promise.

Last year, the county received notification that we will receive a portion of the state's $641 million opioid settlement with Johnson & Johnson and the nation's three largest pharmaceutical distributors to supplement local addiction prevention, treatment and recovery.

Thanks to the leadership and advocacy of Commissioner Tom Sullivan and the 10 years chairman of the Board of Commissioners, the county deployed Narcan in all our facilities and made training available to all employees on how to wait that flight over dope and administer Narcan because knowing the signs and having equipment can help save lives.

Tom, thank you.

And finally, working with the Prosecutor and Charity's Office last year, the County Division of Mental Health and Addiction Services launched the Hope One Task Force and Hope One Multivand, which will be a game changer in the county's fight against addiction by bringing recovery support services and stigma-free care directly into our communities.

To ensure that our services and programs are as diverse as the residents of Burton County, we established two new permanent offices within the Department of Human Services.

Establishing the Office of LGBTQ+ Services will allow for a safe and welcoming environment for individuals who identify as LGBTQ+ in Burton County while also promoting visibility and acceptance.

The office provides a hotline for residents in need of referrals for crisis intervention, counseling, legal acrobatics, and education.

In addition, the Burton County Food Security Task Force became the Office of Food Security, a permanent resource for our food pantries and their clients.

The office recently concluded its third round of Counties of the County's Food Pantry Sustainability Grants, which, over the life of the grant program, has distributed $1.6 million to the nearly 60 different organizations in Burton County.

There are some special folks here today that I would like to recognize.

They have been partners in this effort since day one.

First, let me thank Commissioner Tracy Zor for her leadership and vision to spear this initiative.

I also want to recognize the Sisters in Leadership from the Franciscan Community Development Center of Fairview.

Operating the busiest local food pantry in all of Burton County, the FCDC provides healthy food options to nearly 5,000 residents every month.

Thank you for the work you do every day helping those in the greatest need.

Thank you so much.

[Applause] In 2020, the Department of Human Services added new programs and staff members to its roster, adapting to the ever-changing needs of our communities.

Our Division of Veterans Services helped secure over $1 million in earned benefits for Burton County veterans and their families last year.

Further expanded their community outreach efforts and hired one additional employee.

Burton County will continue to focus on supporting our active duty military and veterans because, as I said before, if we can't take care of those who put their lives on hold to defend our country, then who else should we be doing this for?

The Division of Senior Services also launched its dementia-friendly initiative, which will increase awareness and understanding about dementia and collaborate with public, private, and not non-profit health care partners to better serve people with dementia and their caregivers.

With approximately 20,000 Burton County residents living with some form of dementia, this initiative will play a truly, this initiative will truly be a catalyst for change here in Burton County.

When we talk about directly impacting lives and providing essential care, the Department of Public Works Division of Community Transportation serves as a lifeline for those with limited mobility.

Last year alone, our dedicated team drove over 1.1 million miles facilitating life-saving trips to medical appointments, dialysis treatment, grocery stores, and more.

This division is not just a mode of transportation, it is, it can be one's only means of mobility.

Not to mention, they perform the yeoman's book of deliveries of Burton County meals on wheels, bringing life-saving nutrition and wellness to resident store steps.

I want to extend my deepest gratitude to the 92 employees who make this vital service possible, embodying professionalism, timeliness, and compassion every single day.

Thank you to those names.

In 1998, the residents of Burton County voted to preserve open space as a collective effort to boost the health and well-being of our communities throughout the establishment of Burton County Open Space Trust Fund.

This past December, that initiative celebrated its 25th anniversary spearheaded by my friend, former county executive Pat Shuler.

Pat, thank you for having the foresight to bring this important program to the people of Burton County.

We truly, truly thank you for having that foresight and making a difference on the lives of so many people here in Burton County.

Thank you so much.

In 25 years, the Trust Fund has awarded over $280 million to support 1,546 projects to acquire, preserve, and maintain open space in all 70 Burton County municipalities.

Pat, again, we can't thank you enough for what's your foresight for what's for this camera.

In 2023 alone, we awarded $11.5 million to support 58 municipal parks improvement, land acquisitions, and historic preservation projects.

Our county parks department also made significant progress on several historic preservation efforts, completing the sensitive restoration work at Garrison Forge, Warton Dye Farm, and the Campbell Christie House.

We also focused on parks and recreation improvements, like the resurfaced sports court in the Wooddale County Park, Ordering Woodcliffe Lake in Hillsdale, Samuel Melton Park in Wellington, and the Rochelle Park section of the Salon River County Park.

These renovations included the addition of, yes, the fastest growing sport in America, piccolo ball.

Except for, expect sport court renovations to continue this year, Advancement County Park in Paramus, Pasquale Grove County Park in Westwood, and Glen Rock and Dunklebrook sections of the Salon River County Park.

Winter Wonderland 2023-2024 was a huge success.

By far our busiest season ever, ice bumper cars continued to be popular selling out in those sections.

This year, we added live music provided by local musicians.

A new layout with outdoor dining and additional firefits provided a true Rocky Mountain winter atmosphere.

Burden County's Winter Wonderland has now become the Bryant Park of New Jersey without the bridge holes, parking fees, and congestion pricing tax.

Winter Wonderland in Burden County offers affordable prices, and most of all a safe and friendly place for families to enjoy and have fun.

Stay tuned for next year's Winter Wonderland 2023-2024-2025.

It's going to be even better.

The 2000 and affirmed that out of all regions in Burden County, Southern Burden County was in the greatest need of additional parks and recreational space.

This is something my colleague, Commissioner Steetson-Elly has long said, even before the document's publication, and has advocated for since he began serving on Commission Award in 2013.

As you know, Steve, we're making steady progress at Riverside County Park, where our Parks Department is leading a transformational revitalization of this Southern Burden County jam along the Lake River.

Two years ago, we held both collegiate and high school regattas at the new Burden County Roaming Center, and last summer we held the first concert at the new Riverside County Park, South Amnitheater.

Work will commence on Phase 2, a $13 million project that includes new walking paths, additional lighting, and construction of a completely inclusive playground, which will allow children of all abilities to play with their peers and caregivers, regardless of physical, social, or cognitive needs.

This will be a game changer in that area.

The Division of Golf had an excellent year, which began with the newly renovated Darlington driving range and concluded with the installation of new restroom facilities located on the golf course in all six golf courses.

Equipped with green flush technology and solar panels, these facilities require no outside utilities such as water or electricity, significantly reducing their environmental impact.

These upgrades contributed to a record year of hosting over 320,000 rounds of golf.

This momentum continues in 2024 as we will begin the construction of the new clubhouse at Clark Barn at Overpeck County Golf Course that will feature the latest sustainable technology.

And finally, we are planning to further build out our EV charging capacity through our park system.

Thanks to the private public partnership with both the charging, the county currently has seven electric vehicle charging stations at Ben Son and Overpeck County Park that are free, free to the public.

My team and I are sitting down with representatives from Volta charging next week to discuss how we can further build out our shared services network and other chargers.

However, my administration's commitment to green technology, improving the environment, and promoting sustainability goes so much further than our county's park system.

From transitioning county facilities to renewable energy, to completing two major ecological restoration projects, to increasing the number of electrical vehicles in our county fleet, the county continues to go green.

But up until now these initiatives have been accomplished piecemeal without a formal policy or plan guiding our course forward.

Well, that changes today.

I'm pleased to announce that using funding from the United States Department of Energy, we will undertake the Bourbon County Energy Action Plan.

This first-of-a-kind county-wide plan in the state of New Jersey will provide guidance on a wide range of initiatives in energy planning and efficiency, fleet of the electricity, fleet electrification, and transportation plan, renewable energy, resiliency, and more.

The Energy Action Plan will chart the county's energy and sustainability future, and not only help the county reduce its carbon footprint and improve air and water quality, but help guide our workforce into new green jobs for the future.

It will also assist our 70 municipalities in pursuing their own sustainability initiatives and provide guidance, essential guidance, for our entire region, bringing our county in line with the goals set out by the New Jersey Energy Master Plan.

But while we are doing our part to build towards a greener and more sustainable future, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, where MTA seemingly has other plans, I cannot begin to tell you how frustrated I am with the current congestion pricing scheme proposed by the city of New York.

The MTA's attempt to balance years of fiscal mismanagement on the backs of Bourbon County residents and businesses is shameful and must be stopped.

That is why the county looks forward to our day in court in April as we join New Jersey's lawsuit to block this money grant from going into effect.

This unilateral decision by New York does not consider the negative impact it will have on the community's neighboring Manhattan that will bear the brunt of this dramatic increase in traffic and air pollution from drivers seeking to avoid the congestion tax.

And while the congestion tax scheme is bad enough for Bourbon commuters, the federal government has drastically derailed the Hudson Light Rail extension into Bourbon County.

You notice I said the Hudson Light Rail, there is no bourbon Hudson Light Rail.

I want to make something crystal clear, the extension of the Hudson Light Rail into Bourbon County is not a lot true.

It isn't a necessity.

Eastern Bourbon County is the only major New York suburb that does not have viable rail service.

That is unacceptable for the hundreds of thousands of people who live in one of the most densely populated regions in this country.

This project holds the key to alleviating congestion, meeting the ever-growing demand for mass transit in our community, and ultimately fostering a healthier and sustainable environment for the region.

It is well past time for the federal transit administration and others to step up and commit to the immediate funding required to get this project back on track.

I am calling on all of our Bourbon County legislation delegation from Malwa to North Allington, from Fort Lee to Oakland, to come together as one collective bipartisan voice to make this project a reality.

We cannot afford to let bureaucracy and indecision derail this vitally important transportation project that our residents so desperately need.

We will succeed.

Even with the light rail project stall, that hasn't stopped the county's planning and engineering department and public works operation division from tackling impressive workloads this past year, overseeing the completion of 21.8 million dollars in local infrastructure upgrades across the county.

From fixing culverts to road resurfacing, to filling over 2,500 pop holes, to improving drainage and intersections along county arteries, to upgrading several intersections with modern traffic control signals.

This administration keeps working to improve critical infrastructure that keeps residents moving.

But there's always more to do and this year we plan on tripling our road resurfacing capacity from 2023.

Tom, triple Tom, and continue our efforts to advance progress on the Kingsland Bridge in southern Bourbon County, the Anderson Street Bridge connecting T-neck and Hackensack and the Oradell Avenue Bridge in Oradell.

Another initiative born out of the pandemic and as an answer to President Biden's call to ensure all Americans have equitable access to the internet, it is the county's plan to bring broadband internet to the doorstep of every barrel hole and municipal library in Bourbon County.

Led by open partner Millennium Communications Group, this initiative began as a way to ensure that all county facilities operated on a redundant private IP network entirely controlled by the county.

To do so, we spent the last two years running quietly to every county-owned building from North Arlington to Maui.

How many times do I say North Arlington today?

I am proud to say that the project is now 100 complete with every single operating with every single building operating on our private ISP, not third-party commercial carriers like Verizon, Optum, or Comcast.

Now that the county owns its own fiber, we don't have to worry about date and switch rate changes.

The network is more secure and above all else, our bandwidth speed is our bandwidth speed.

There is no need to worry about our carry-up throttling the network during peak hours, not to mention, not to mention there will be significant savings for the taxpayers.

But why should only the county realize savings?

There is a unique opportunity here to offer bourbon fiber as a shared service to all our municipalities.

Soon, they will have the option to join our secure and reliable network, bringing cost savings to their residents.

The county is currently in conversations with our first two pilot towns, with connections being established very soon, and it is my hope to be one of the only governmental entities in the country to bring fiber.

I mean bourbon fiber to several others by the end of the year, fostering a more connected and resilient bourbon county.

This will enable all bourbon county residents to have access to the internet via the ever-growing bourbon fiber highway.

Now, let me talk about another highway that has caused everyone in this room a major headache.

I'm excited to report that the most critical highway infrastructure project, impacting every motorist that traverses through north jersey, is on a path forward.

A project that will improve the flow of billions in interstate corners, mitigate traffic congestion, and improve safety and air quality for communities along this corridor.

We finally are on a path to fix the route 17.

After years of painstaking effort by the county, and yes, even as the mayor perhaps, the route 17 bottlenecks project concept development plan was approved over the summer.

And in September, I had the privilege and voted as part of the North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority, NJTPA, to allocate $338.5 million to fund the project through the Regional Improvement Transportation Program or TIP.

This is significant because we now have a firm funding commitment to widen the highway and replace the five aging bridges along the Essex Street to Barview Avenue corridor, which date back into the 1930s.

I want to thank our exceptional team at the county for their efforts to guide the project to this point, and the NJTPA Governor and DOT Commissioner for their advocacy and support.

Last year, later this year, residents will begin to see activity along the car as the project moves from the preliminary engineering phase under the authority of the NJ DOT.

With the support of our legislative leaders in districts 36 and 38, the county was able to secure $10 million in state funding to make improvements on Rochelle Avenue and Rochelle Park, which will be completed prior to the work on the highway.

I want to take this opportunity to thank the men in Wynnum of Labor, especially the building and construction trades for the great work they do every day throughout Burden County and New Jersey to make our roads safer and build our buildings.

Thank you so much.

With billions of dollars in interstate commerce flowing through Burden County annually, we truly stand as the economic engine for the state of New Jersey.

We have the statistics to back that up.

Our rateable base continues to grow every year, totally 207.7 billion, 207.7 billion, with a B in 2023, which is 27 percent higher than any other county in the state of New Jersey.

This allows us to deliver the second lowest county tax rate once again in the state, the second lowest tax rate in the state of New Jersey.

Throw in our triple bond rating and you can see why Burden County knows business.

Our economy is thriving as we continue to take initiatives that we that will ensure success for our businesses and job seekers alike.

In anticipation of an anticipation of upcoming opportunities from New Jersey's growing film industry as the birthplace of the motion picture industry and the home to the Barrymore Film Center, the county filed to become the second state designated film ready as county.

Then working in partnership with Burden Community College last October, we held our first in-person job fair since COVID, which saw record job seekers attendance and featured booths from over 100 employers.

The college and county economic development team also continued their partnership to support small businesses through the Burden Business Resource Network.

This program gives Burden Community College students real-life skills and local businesses consulting assistance they may otherwise not be able to afford.

As a resource specialist, Burden Community College students have aided over 1,200 small businesses, nearly doubled from last year in developing social media strategies applying for grants and loans and designing websites through BurdenForBusiness.com all free of charge.

Yep, all free of charge.

Just recently I had the opportunity to cut the ribbon at the unveiling of the Business Innovation Center at the Lindhurst campus, which is helping students break into fields of game design, cybersecurity, finance, and the college continues to pioneer new ways to inspire the next generation of business leaders.

The partnership between the county of Burden and the college has never been strong.

Students have opportunities to gain hands-on experience across nearly every education sector.

For example, Burden Community College and Burden Nucreage Medical Center have an excellent program that has allowed hundreds of students in healthcare profession programs to complete clinical rotations at the county hospital with many, except in full-time employment, offers after graduation.

Well, last year the county created a new vocational technical, sorry, create a new program that allows Burden Community College veterinary tech students to earn credits while working at the Burden County Animal Shelter.

Opportunities like these demonstrate why Burden Community College continues to rank as the number one community college in the state of New Jersey and the most affordable option for students in North Jersey.

I want to thank Burden Community College President Eric Friedman, who is here today.

Eric, thank you for your passion and for your commitment.

For your commitment to providing quality and innovative educational opportunities for your students while bringing equity, inclusion, and diversity to that campus.

The county's support of the Technical and Special Services School District also remains unwavering and I'm proud to say for the ninth year in a row we increase funding to both school districts.

I want to thank the Board of Commissioners for their continued support for our Special Services and Technical School District.

This year was particularly notable for the Special Services School District as the Bleshmian Regional Day School received the prestigious honor from Apple.

Yes, the same Apple that makes the iPhone becoming one of the only special needs schools in the nation to be designators in Apple Distinguished School for utilizing innovative technology to force their learning.

Congratulations.

As we broke ground on a new career in Technical Educational School in parameters that will feature programs tailored to address shortages in the high demand field of fabrication and design at logistics and dental science.

We look forward to welcoming the first ninth grade class in September of 2025.

Along with welcoming the new class, new teachers will be moving in.

Teachers play an important role in the overall development of our students.

Fortunately here in Bergen County we have the best of the best educators.

I want to thank them for the work they do daily making a positive difference in the lives of so many young people.

I want to particularly give a shout out to the BCEA and NJEA for your leadership.

Sue McBride, thank you for being here.

And I do need to give a special shout out to all our special education teachers.

They do some work every day.

Thank you.

Before I conclude I'd like to share two exciting pieces of news.

The first, as you may have heard, it is that it is that the 2026 FIFA World Cup Final will take place right here in Bergen County and met life-saving.

With over 1.5 billion fans across the globe expected to tune in, this is an incredible once-in-a-lifetime moment for our county, our state, and our region.

I look forward to hearing from the host committee, the NJEA, and the state on how we, Bergen counties, will play a role as the host county on the largest stage in all its forms.

Know that Bergen County is ready to meet the challenges required of this world event.

Get ready to witness history, feel the pulse of the game, and celebrate the unity that SACHA brings to the world right here in Bergen County.

In addition, in addition the World Cup 2026 will mark another momentous occasion.

The 250th birthday of our great nation, our division of cultural and historic affairs, is spearheading the Bergen 250 initiative, which over the course of the next three years will host several events and activities to commemorate Bergen County's role in the American Revolution.

Well, I personally think there's only one way to ring in the 250th anniversary of our nation on July 4, 2026, and that's with a big bang.

I'm so excited to announce that starting this July 4, you will all be invited to attend a new county tradition where residents will be able to celebrate our nation's founding with a special summer concert and fireworks spectacular in Oberpeck County Park, the central park of Bergen County.

So much is happening here in Bergen County, and I want to once again thank the hard-working men and women who have dedicated their careers in public service with the county.

It's because of all of you and our wonderful partner institutions that Bergen County remains the best place in the state of New Jersey, if not the entire country, to live, to work, and to raise a family.

As I said at the beginning, this is my tenth state of the county address, and I could not be proud of everything that we have accomplished together and all that we will continue to achieve on behalf of more residents and communities in the year ahead.

Bergen County is the best county in New Jersey.

No one can argue that.

With the continual commitment and dedication from everyone involved, Bergen County will continue to support businesses be environmentally friendly and stay affordable, and most of all, be a safe county.

Thank you all for joining me here today, and for all that you do every day on behalf of the people of Bergen County, I truly thank all of you for what you did, what you do every day to make this county the best county in the state of New Jersey.

Be well everyone.

Thank you.

[Applause] Thank you everyone.

Please get home safe, get back to work safe.
