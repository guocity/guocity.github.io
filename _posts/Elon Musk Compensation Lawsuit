    C.A. No. 2018-0408-KSJM
    POST-TRIAL OPINION
    Date Submitted: April 25, 2023
    Date Decided: January 30, 2024

Here is the summary of the court opinion:

- **Background**: The plaintiff, a Tesla stockholder, challenges the 2018 compensation plan for Elon Musk, Tesla's CEO and controlling stockholder, as a conflicted-controller transaction that was not entirely fair to Tesla.
- **Process**: The court finds that the process leading to the approval of the compensation plan was deeply flawed, as Musk had extensive ties with the persons tasked with negotiating on Tesla's behalf and there was no meaningful negotiation over any of the terms of the plan¹.
- **Price**: The court finds that the price of the compensation plan was unfair, as it offered Musk an unprecedented opportunity to secure 12 tranches of options, each representing 1% of Tesla's total outstanding shares, for achieving market capitalization and operational milestones that were not sufficiently ambitious or difficult.
- **Remedy**: The court grants the plaintiff's request for rescission of the compensation plan, as it is the preferred remedy for breaches of fiduciary duty when rescission can restore the parties to the position they occupied before the challenged transaction.
- **The Board of Directors**: The page introduces the backgrounds and relationships of the Tesla board members, especially those who served on the Compensation Committee that approved the 2018 Grant for Elon Musk. It also describes the personal and financial ties between some of the directors and Musk, as well as their involvement in other Musk-related ventures.
- **Musk Proposes Terms Of A Compensation Plan**: The page recounts how Ira Ehrenpreis, the chairman of the Compensation Committee, contacted Musk in April 2017 to discuss his future commitment to Tesla. Musk suggested a performance-based compensation plan that would reward him for increasing Tesla's market capitalization by $750 billion in 15 milestones of $50 billion each¹.
- **Musk States That He Is Committed To Tesla For Life**: The page notes that Musk clarified his intention to stay involved with Tesla for the rest of his life, after making a remark that he should not be CEO forever during an earnings call in May 2017. The page also cites testimonies from trial witnesses that Musk never expressed any plans to quit Tesla or demanded more compensation.
- **The First (And Forgettable) Board Discussion**: The page reports that the Board briefly discussed the possibility of a new compensation plan for Musk during a June 6, 2017 meeting, but the discussion was not substantive or memorable². The page also mentions that the 2012 Grant was nearly fulfilled by then.
- **Musk Accelerates The Process**: The page details how Musk asked to discuss his compensation plan on June 18, 2017, and how Todd Maron, Tesla's General Counsel, led a team of Tesla executives and external advisors to work on the plan. The page also reveals that Maron proposed an aggressive timeline for approving the plan by late July 2017, and that Ehrenpreis agreed with it.
- **The First Compensation Committee Discussion**: The page describes the first meeting of the Compensation Committee on June 23, 2017, where they formally retained Wilson Sonsini and Compensia as legal advisor and compensation consultant, respectively. The page also states that Ehrenpreis informed the committee that the aim was to create a new compensation plan similar to the 2012 Grant.
- **The committee**: This section describes how the Tesla Compensation Committee discussed and developed a new compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk in 2017, with the help of a Working Group and external advisors.
- **Musk's proposal**: This section reveals that Musk initially proposed a 15-tranche structure that would award him 15% of total outstanding shares if he could increase Tesla's market capitalization by $750 billion, but later reduced his ask to 10% of shares for a $550 billion increase.
- **Stockholder outreach**: This section reports that Ehrenpreis and Maron contacted Tesla's largest institutional stockholders to solicit their feedback and input on Musk's compensation plan, and that the stockholders generally supported a similar approach to the 2012 Grant.
- **Operational milestones**: This section explains how Ahuja and his team developed the operational milestones for the 2018 Grant, based on revenue and adjusted EBITDA metrics, and how they compared Tesla's performance to its peers.
Here is a summary of part 4 of the current page:
- **Musk's Negotiation with the Board**: The page describes how Musk proposed different terms for his 2018 Grant, such as the size, structure, and milestones, and how the Board responded to his requests. The page also details how Musk "negotiated against himself" by lowering his demand or accepting stricter terms on some occasions.
- **The Final Terms of the Grant**: The page lists the key features of the 2018 Grant, such as the 12-tranche structure, the market capitalization and operational milestones, the leadership requirement, the M&A adjustment, and the five-year hold period. The page also explains the rationale and process behind each term.
- **The Grant Date Fair Value**: The page reports how Burg, Tesla's valuation expert, calculated the grant date fair value of the 2018 Grant using Monte Carlo simulations and other assumptions. The page also shows how the valuation changed over time based on different inputs and scenarios.
- **The Board Approval**: The page recounts how the Board unanimously approved the 2018 Grant on January 21, 2018, after reviewing the final terms and projections. The page also notes that the Board conditioned the 2018 Grant on approval by a majority vote of disinterested stockholders¹.
Here is a summary of part 5 of the current page:
- **Stockholder Criticism**: Some stockholders opposed the Grant, arguing that it was too large, too easy, and unnecessary for Musk's motivation. They also questioned the linear milestones for an exponential company like Tesla.
- **Vote Uncertainty**: Maron informed the Board that the outcome of the stockholder vote was not clear, and that some large stockholders were voting against the Grant. Musk asked Maron to tell one of them that he was offended and wanted them to divest from Tesla.
- **Vote Approval**: The stockholders approved the Grant on March 21, 2018, with 73% of votes cast in favor, excluding Musk's and Kimbal's shares¹.
- **Probable Milestones**: Tesla disclosed that three operational milestones ($20 billion revenue, $1.5 billion adjusted EBITDA, and $3 billion adjusted EBITDA) were considered probable of achievement, based on its aggressive and risky operating plan.
- Part 6 discusses the plaintiff's theories of general and transaction-specific control by Musk over Tesla, and the court's analysis of the evidence¹.
- **Stock Ownership**: Musk's 21.9% block of Tesla shares gives him significant influence over stockholder votes and board decisions, especially for bylaw amendments that require a supermajority vote².
- **Boardroom And Managerial Supremacy**: Musk occupies the most powerful roles of CEO, chair, and founder, and exercises managerial authority over all aspects of Tesla, often without regard to board authority. He is also considered a "Superstar CEO" who is uniquely valuable to the company, which affects the board's oversight and deference to him.
- **Relationships With The Board**: Musk has extensive business and personal ties with four of the eight directors (Kimbal, Gracias, Murdoch, and Ehrenpreis), rendering them beholden to him. The other four directors (Buss, Denholm, Johnson Rice, and Jurvetson) have varying degrees of independence from Musk.
- **The Process**: The board's posture toward Musk during the process that led to the Grant shows that they were not acting in the best interests of the company, but rather as "supine servants" of Musk³. The board allowed Musk to dictate the timing and terms of the Grant, and did not engage in any meaningful negotiation or oversight⁴. The court concludes that, with respect to the Grant, Musk controlled Tesla⁵.
- **Musk's control over the Grant process**: The page argues that Musk exercised transaction-specific control over the Grant by dictating the timeline, the size, and the other terms of the Grant, and by collaborating with the Compensation Committee rather than negotiating against them.
- **Lack of arm's length negotiation**: The page contends that the Compensation Committee and the Board failed to negotiate the overall size or difficulty of the Grant with Musk, and did not conduct a traditional benchmarking analysis to compare the Grant to market comparables¹.
- **Defendants' burden of proving entire fairness**: The page explains that because Musk controlled the Grant process, the entire fairness standard applies, and the defendants bear the burden of proof unless they can show that the stockholder vote was fully informed².
- **Insufficient conflict disclosures**: The page asserts that the Proxy failed to disclose the Compensation Committee members' potential conflicts and omitted material information concerning the process, thus rendering the stockholder vote uninformed and preventing the burden shift³.
- **The Grant Process Lacked A Traditional Benchmarking Analysis**. The page explains why the process of granting compensation to Musk did not involve a comparison of his plan to other similar companies or executives, which is a common and critical practice in setting CEO pay. The page argues that the defendants' reasons for not performing a benchmarking study were weak and unconvincing, and that the lack of benchmarking showed the board's failure to negotiate the size and difficulty of the grant with Musk.
- **The Defendants Failed To Prove That The Stockholder Vote Was Fully Informed**¹. The page contends that the proxy statement that solicited the stockholder approval of the grant was materially misleading and omitted important information, such as the potential conflicts of the compensation committee members and the details of the process that led to the grant. The page asserts that the defendants did not meet their burden of showing that the stockholders were apprised of all material information related to the grant, and thus could not shift the burden of proving entire fairness to the plaintiff¹.
- **Entire Fairness Standard**: The court applies the entire fairness standard to evaluate the compensation plan for Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk, which was approved by the board and the stockholders. The entire fairness standard consists of two aspects: fair dealing and fair price.
- **Fair Dealing**: The court examines the process by which the compensation plan was designed, negotiated, and approved, and finds that it was tainted by conflicts of interest, lack of independence, inadequate information, and undue influence by Musk.
- **Fair Price**: The court looks at the economic and financial considerations of the compensation plan to determine if it was substantively fair. The court rejects the defendants' arguments that the plan was fair based on the give/get model, the unique circumstances and CEO, the only upside structure, the ambitious milestones, the private-equity analogy, and the stockholder vote. The court finds that the defendants failed to prove that the plan falls within a range of fairness¹.
- **The stockholder vote on the Grant** - The court rejects the plaintiff's argument that the vote was legally required and thus invalidates the Grant due to disclosure failures. The court holds that the vote was voluntary and only affected the standard of review, not the validity of the transaction.
- **The remedy of rescission** - The court exercises its discretion to order rescission of the Grant as a remedy for the defendants' fiduciary breaches¹. The court finds that rescission is reasonable, appropriate, and practicable, and that the defendants failed to prove that the Grant was fair or to offer a viable alternative remedy². The court also resolves any uncertainty in awarding damages against the defendants as the wrongdoers.

以下是法院意见的摘要：

- **背景**：原告是特斯拉的股东，对特斯拉首席执行官、控股股东埃隆·马斯克的2018年薪酬计划提出质疑，认为这是一项存在利益冲突的交易，对特斯拉不够公平。
- **程序**：法院认为导致薪酬计划获批的程序存在严重缺陷，因为马斯克与负责代表特斯拉进行谈判的人员有密切的联系，而且在计划的任何条款上没有进行实质性的谈判¹。
- **价格**：法院认为薪酬计划的价格不公平，因为它为马斯克提供了一个前所未有的机会，即通过实现市值和运营里程碑来获得12个期权档次，每个档次代表特斯拉总股本的1%，而这些目标并不足够宏伟或困难。
- **补救措施**：法院支持原告请求废除薪酬计划，因为在违反受托责任时，废除是一种可以将各方恢复到挑战性交易之前状态的首选补救措施。
- **董事会**：该页面介绍了特斯拉董事会成员的背景和关系，特别是那些参与批准2018年对埃隆·马斯克的授予的薪酬委员会的成员。页面还描述了一些董事与马斯克的个人和财务关系，以及他们参与其他与马斯克相关的事务。
- **马斯克提出薪酬计划的条件**：页面记述了2017年4月，薪酬委员会主席艾拉·艾伦普莱斯与马斯克联系，讨论了他对特斯拉未来承诺的问题。马斯克提出了一个基于市值增加的绩效薪酬计划，要求他在15个50亿美元的里程碑中增加特斯拉的市值7500亿美元¹。

- **委员会**：本节描述了特斯拉薪酬委员会如何在2017年与工作组和外部顾问的帮助下，讨论和制定了首席执行官埃隆·马斯克的新薪酬计划。
- **马斯克的提议**：本节透露，马斯克最初提出了一个包含15个档次的结构，如果他能通过使特斯拉的市值增加7500亿美元，就能获得15%的总股本，但后来将要求降低到通过增加5500亿美元获得10%的股份。

这是当前页面第4部分的摘要：
- **马斯克与董事会的谈判**：页面描述了马斯克对2018年授予计划提出不同条件的过程，如规模、结构和里程碑，以及董事会对他的要求作出的回应。页面还详细说明了马斯克如何在某些场合降低他的要求或接受更严格的条件。
- **授予的最终条件**：页面列举了2018年授予计划的关键特征，如12个档次的结构、市值和运营里程碑、领导要求、并购调整和五年持有期。页面还解释了每个条件背后的原理和过程。
- **授予日期的公允价值**：页面报告了特拉公司的估值专家伯格如何使用蒙特卡洛模拟和其他假设计算了2018年授予计划的授予日期公允价值。页面还展示了基于不同输入和情景的估值如何随时间变化。

这是当前页面第5部分的摘要：
- **股东批评**：一些股东反对该授予计划，认为它过大、过于简单，对于马斯克的动机来说是不必要的。他们还对一个像特斯拉这样的指数公司采用线性里程碑提出了质疑。
- **投票不确定性**：马隆告诉董事会，股东投票结果不明朗，一些大股东正在反对该授予计划。马斯克要求马隆告诉其中一个股东，他感到受到了冒犯，并希望他们剥离特斯拉。
- **投票批准**：股东于2018年3月21日通过了该授予计划，73%的投票赞成，不包括马斯克和Kimbal的股份¹。
- **可能的里程碑**：特拉公司披露，根据其积极而有风险的经营计划，已经认为三个运营里程碑（200亿美元收入、15亿美元调整后的EBITDA和30亿美元调整后的EBITDA）有望实现。
- 第6部分讨论了原告关于马斯克对特斯拉的一般和交易特定控制的理论，以及法院对证据的分析¹。
- **股权拥有**：马斯克拥有特斯拉21.9%的股份，使他在股东投票和董事会决策方面具有重大影响力，特别是对于需要超级多数投票的公司条例修改²。
- **董事会和管理至上**：马斯克担任首席执行官、主席和创始人等最权力的角色，对特斯拉的所有方面行使管理权力，通常不考虑董事会的权威。他还被认为是一位“超级首席执行官”，对公司非常重要，这影响了董事会对他的监督和顺从。
- **与董事会的关系**：马斯克与董事会的四名八名成员（Kimbal、Gracias、Murdoch和Ehrenpreis）有广泛的商业和个人联系，使他们对他感到依赖。其他四名董事（Buss、Denholm、Johnson Rice和Jurvetson）对马斯克的独立程度各不相同。
- **过程**：董事会在导致该授予的过程中对待马斯克的态度表明他们并未着眼于公司的最佳利益，而是像马斯克的“卑躬屈膝的仆人”一样行事³。董事会允许马斯克决定授予的时间和条件，并没有进行任何实质性的谈判或监督⁴。法院得出结论，就该授予而言，马斯克控制了特斯拉⁵。
- **马斯克对授予过程的控制**：页面认为，马斯克通过制定授予的时间、规模和其他条件以及与薪酬委员会合作而非对抗他们，行使了特定交易的控制。
- **缺乏独立谈判**：页面主张薪

酬委员会和董事会未能与马斯克就授予的总体规模或难度进行谈判，并且没有进行传统的市场比较分析，以比较授予与市场可比公司的情况¹。
- **被告证明全面公平的责任**：页面解释说，由于马斯克控制了授予的过程，因此适用全面公平的标准，除非被告能够证明股东投票是充分知情的，否则他们负有举证责任²。
- **冲突披露不足**：页面断言，代理声明未披露薪酬委员会成员的潜在冲突，并且省略了与该授予有关的过程的重要信息，从而使股东投票不知情，阻止了责任转移³。
- **授予过程缺乏传统的基准分析**。页面解释了向马斯克授予薪酬的过程为何没有涉及将其计划与其他类似公司或高管进行比较的常见而关键的做法。页面认为被告没有进行基准研究的理由是站不住脚的，令人难以置信，而且缺乏基准分析显示了董事会未能与马斯克谈判授予的规模和难度。
- **被告未能证明股东投票是充分知情的**¹。页面主张请求股东批准授予的代理声明在实质上是误导性的，并省略了重要信息，比如薪酬委员会成员的潜在冲突和导致授予的过程的细节。页面断言被告未能证明股东已经了解与授予相关的所有重要信息，因此不能将证明全面公平的责任转移到原告¹。
- **全面公平标准**：法院应用全面公平标准评估特斯拉首席执行官埃隆·马斯克的薪酬计划，该计划得到了董事会和股东的批准。全面公平标准包括公平交易和公平价格两个方面。
- **公平交易**：法院审查了制定、谈判和批准薪酬计划的过程，发现它受到了利益冲突、缺乏独立性、信息不足以及马斯克的不当影响的影响。
- **公平价格**：法院审查了薪酬计划的经济和财务考虑，以确定它是否在实质上公平。法院拒绝了被告以给予/获得模型、独特情况和首席执行官的论点，以及股东投票为依据的计划是公平的论点。法院认为被告未能证明该计划处于公平范围内¹。
- **对授予的股东投票** - 法院拒绝了原告的论点，即股东投票在法律上是必需的，因此由于披露不足而使授予失效。法院认为投票是自愿的，只影响审查标准，而不影响交易的有效性。
- **废除的救济措施** - 法院行使其自由裁量权，命令废除授予作为被告违反受托责任的救济措施¹。法院认为废除是合理、适当且可行的，而被告未能证明授予是公平的或提供可行的替代救济²。法院还解决了对被告的损害的不确定性，将损害赔偿授予被告作为违法者。
